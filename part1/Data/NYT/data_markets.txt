WASHINGTON — The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits dropped to a 49-1/2-year low last week, pointing to sustained labor market strength that could assuage fears the economy was rapidly losing momentum.Other data on Thursday showed producer prices increased by the most in five months in March amid a surge in the cost of gasoline. But underlying producer prices remained soft, the latest indication of tame inflation pressures that strengthen the Federal Reserve's decision to suspend further interest rate increases this year despite a tight labor market."The economy's wheels continue to turn and any thought that growth was going to stop has to be reassessed," said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. "Fed officials are on the sidelines awaiting confirmation of what to do next."Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 196,000 for the week ended April 6, the Labor Department said. That was the lowest level since October 1969, when the size of the labor market was about half of what it is now. Claims have declined for four straight weeks. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 211,000 in the latest week. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 7,000 to 207,000 last week, the lowest level since December 1969.The labor market's strength should allay worries of an abrupt slowdown in economic growth, which gained traction after the U.S. Treasury yield curve briefly inverted in late March.The economy lost speed at the turn of the year, reflecting fading stimulus from a $1.5 trillion tax cut package, trade tensions between China and the United States and weak global growth. Data, including retail sales and the trade deficit, have improved, raising the possibility that the anticipated slowdown in growth in the first quarter will not be steep.Goldman Sachs is forecasting gross domestic product rising at a 1.6% annualized rate in the first quarter. The economy grew at a 2.2% pace in the October-December period.Job growth in the first quarter averaged 180,000 per month, well above the roughly 100,000 needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population. At 3.8%, the unemployment rate is near the 3.7% Fed officials project it will be by the end of the year. U.S. Treasury prices fell, while the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street were trading marginally higher.WEAK CORE INFLATIONIn a second report on Thursday, the Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand rose 0.6% in March, the largest increase since last October, after edging up 0.1% in February.In the 12 months through March, the PPI rose 2.2% after advancing 1.9% in the 12 months through February. Economists had forecast the PPI climbing 0.3% in March and increasing 1.9% on a year-on-year basis.A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services was unchanged last month after ticking up 0.1% in February. The so-called core PPI increased 2.0% in the 12 months through March. That was the smallest annual increase since August 2017 and followed a 2.3% rise in February.Data on Wednesday showed consumer prices rose by the most in 14 months in March, driven by more expensive gasoline. But core inflation remained muted amid a plunge in the cost of apparel."The recent consumer and producer price data don't point to any major acceleration or deceleration in inflation," said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. "Therefore, the Fed will feel no economic pressure to do anything."Minutes of the Fed's March 19-20 policy meeting published on Wednesday described inflation as "muted," though officials expected it to rise to or near the U.S. central bank's 2% target. The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, is currently at 1.8%.The minutes showed some Fed officials believed the tame price pressures could be the result of low inflation expectations and also an indication that there was still slack in the labor market despite the very low unemployment rate. Last month, gasoline prices shot up 16.0%, the most since August 2009. Gasoline accounted for over 60% of the 1.% rise in goods prices last month. Goods prices increased 0.4% in February. Prices for healthcare services fell 0.2% last month after rising 0.3% in February. The cost of hospital outpatient services fell by the most since July 2014. Those healthcare costs feed into the core PCE price index and suggested weaker inflation readings in February and March."We look for moderation (in the core PCE price index) to 1.70% in February and 1.60% in March," said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.The Commerce Department will publish February and March PCE price data later this month. (Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao and Dan Grebler)Stocks came very close to entering a bear market on Christmas Eve, which was a very bad thing. Just about everybody said so.Yet the bear-market label is based on a dangerously unscientific understanding of stock markets. It is dangerous because the designation itself can set off a negative popular narrative that may, in itself, help to fuel a bigger market decline.What happened in December? By Dec. 24, the S&P 500 had fallen 19.8 percent from its peak of September 2018.That was just short of the “traditional” 20 percent slide that many say defines a bear market. It has been strongly up since then, but still remains down substantially from that peak.This tradition doesn’t amount to much, though. I discovered, through digital search, that the practice of using precise definitions for down markets — denoting a “correction” as a 10 percent decline from a peak and a “bear market” as a 20 percent decline — is only a little over 30 years old. It dates back to the mid-1980s.People have spoken loosely of bear markets for more than a hundred years, but they didn’t generally attach a 20 percent definition to them.You might think that the precise identification of a bear market occurred because that 20 percent threshold is intrinsically important — because, for example, there are many times when stock market declines stop at around 20 percent.But, actually, that is not a frequent occurrence. In this century, since 2000, there have been exactly two S&P 500 declines of 20 percent from the market peak — and both of them continued much further, for a net decline of around 50 percent.The first such decline started in 2000. The S&P 500 peaked on March 24 of that year but by March 12, 2001, it had declined 20 percent, and newspapers duly called the situation a bear market.Sometimes the wording suggested that the market was nearing its bottom. Writers didn’t know the decline was over, but evidently felt comfortable joking about it: “Bear Country Good Territory for Stock Hunting,” one headline said.That lighthearted approach was unfortunate because the S&P 500 turned out to be less than halfway through its decline. Ultimately, from its 2000 peak it dropped 49.1 percent through Oct. 9, 2002, before turning up. In real terms, correcting for inflation, that was more than a 50 percent price drop from peak to trough.Then there was the stock market of the Great Recession. The S&P 500 peaked on Oct. 9, 2007. It became a bear market, having declined over 20 percent, on July 11, 2008.There were lots of bear jokes that July, with suggestions that the start of a bear market signaled the end of a process: “Stop Worrying and Learn to Love the Bear,” was the headline of a Wall Street Journal article then. Still, the market kept going down, and bottomed on March 9, 2009, after losing 56.7 percent of its peak value.Those two episodes tell us something important: The start of a bear market doesn’t mean much. From a historical perspective, it is clear that a 20 percent decline does not predict further market movements with any certainty.That may not have been obvious between 1980 and 1990, when the 20 percent definition of a bear market first became established, because there were then two fairly recent 20 percent declines from S&P 500 peaks that did not precede sharper falls.On March 3, 1982, after dropping 21.1 percent from a Nov. 28, 1980, peak and entering what we would now call bear market territory, the S&P 500 fell only 6 percent further. And after a one-day S&P 500 decline of 20.5 percent on Oct. 19, 1987, the index fell only 0.4 percent further to a trough on Dec. 4, 1987.In short, the mere diagnosis of a bear market doesn’t seem to carry much weight for forecasting future price drops.Yet let’s not dismiss the effects of a bear market declaration too soon. Simply by announcing that we have entered a bear market and repeating that claim in the echo chamber of social media, the designation itself might create psychological unease that could make for market volatility.Popular labels carry emotional content. If the declarations of bear markets are charged with negativity, bull markets are fraught with symbolic and patriotic feelings.Consider the “Charging Bull” sculpture, symbolizing the bull market vigor of the financial markets, by Arturo Di Modica. It was first installed in 1989 in the aftermath of the 1987 stock market crash, in Bowling Green in the financial district of New York.The initial installation of the bull statue caught the popular imagination. It was the second time, according to Google Ngrams, that “bull” and “bear” were really widely used (the first time being in the boom of the 1920s and the 1929 crash).The statue may be the second most famous sculpture in New York, after the Statue of Liberty, and tourists flock to take selfies with it. It is a symbol of much more than a market direction. According to the sculptor, the statue also symbolizes  “the strength and power of the American people.” It has become an icon of national identity, patriotism and animal spirits.By the same token, the notion that a bear market may be around the corner can be profoundly disruptive. The near-miss diagnosis of a “bear market” on Christmas Eve 2018 seemed to have struck fear and disorientation in many investors, like an inconclusive lab test for a dread disease, making people vulnerable to more pessimistic feelings.Of course, some people may have interpreted the near miss as a clean bill of health, perhaps even a buying opportunity, depending on circumstances and on the narratives they choose to believe.Narratives matter in the stock market, which is, in many ways, a social-psychological barometer. Whether people are exulting about a bull market or running from a bear, volatile emotions are involved. In the next round in the stock market, we will see who outnumbers whom.Five years ago, the classic car market had just completed a turnaround that left even seasoned observers surprised by its speed. The deep recession that began in 2007 had dealt the same initial blow to vintage car prices that it did to the Dow and to the real estate market.The downturn erased four or five years’ worth of gains for collectible cars, by many estimates. But by 2014, most had fully recouped their pre-recession values, and the market has maintained an even keel.There are some signs, however, that the good times may be coming to an end. A mix of factors is at play, including demographics, changes to tax laws and general uncertainty.For auctions in 2018 and early 2019, the sell-through rate (the percentage of cars meeting reserve and selling) for million-dollar-plus cars has dropped about 20 percent from the previous year, according to Hagerty, a classic-car insurer in Michigan. That’s the lowest rate since Hagerty started tracking the statistic in 2008.The wealthiest and most discriminating collectors may simply be taking a pass on the current offerings, or “it may be a sign that the savviest collectors are sensing a change in the tone of the market,” said Brian Rabold, vice president for valuation at Hagerty.If the recent crop of cars isn’t persuading elite collectors to raise their paddles, the question then becomes why aren’t more owners of blue-chip cars selling them?Cam Ingram, a collector and restorer in North Carolina, pointed to last year’s changes in Section 1031 of the tax code, which had allowed the capital gains tax on a sale to be deferred if the proceeds were used to buy another collectible — artwork, say, or cars.“One factor that few people are acknowledging at the moment is the effect of the loss of 1031 exchanges,” Mr. Ingram said. “Top collectors were able to strategically play with positions in their collections to avoid realizing taxes on gains. Now they have to be far more disciplined. The change in the law is affecting both supply and demand.”With the economy still running strong, he added, few top collectors are in a position where they need to sell to free up cash.Both Mr. Ingram and Michael Sheehan, a dealer-broker of vintage Ferraris in Southern California, acknowledged the perception among top collectors that now might be the time to hold the best of the best. When those cars do sell, they often do so off the radar and at still very robust prices, they said. Private sales have always taken place among elite collectors, but now comparatively few big private sales are the exception to the general rule that the top of the market is cooling off.Demographics, too, are influencing this market.“Every day, I get the same calls: Guy dies, his kids don’t want the cars, and they want me to sell them. Or it’s knee surgery, hip surgery or prostate cancer and the owner simply can’t enjoy the car anymore,” Mr. Sheehan said.What Mr. Sheehan describes is most likely the vanguard of a wave of baby boomers getting out of the market, and nobody seems to have a clear idea of what comes next.When the classic-car market rebounded after the recession, it was still boomer-driven, and the very top end came back first, in 2011, according to Hagerty data.“The stock market was still in a slump, and cars were being talked about as one of the few asset classes where good returns could be had,” Mr. Ingram said. “By the next year, the middle of the market (cars costing between $250,000 and $1 million) returned to health, and the year after that, the entry level got active again.”If there is a shift now, it’s still in its early days, and the market may be mirroring its resurgence from 2011 to 2013. The broad entry level continues to be robust, according to Mr. Ingram and Mr. Rabold, while the top end is sluggish, a possible leading indicator of a general slump.The United States economy is in its longest period of growth on record, and most observers predict a downturn reasonably soon. That would certainly affect the classic-car market. But it’s the demographic shift, combined with the potential for another 2008-like crash, that seems to worry the keenest market-watchers the most.“Several things are in play here,” Mr. Sheehan said. “There’s general uncertainty and concern about things like the world economy and Brexit. The boomers are leaving the market in droves.“Younger people can’t drive a stick shift,” he added, “and they can’t afford the cars at the level that the boomers have driven the prices to — they’re busy paying record money for housing, education debt and health care.”At the moment, the market seems to be in a holding pattern.“Gen-Xers and millennials are still priced out of the market,” Mr. Sheehan said. “The last time that the market corrected, in 2008, it turned around quickly after it became apparent that the recession wouldn’t turn into a depression. Baby boomer money was still in play, and it quickly drove prices back to pre-correction levels.”That may not happen again. “The boomers aren’t going to be around to prop the market back up after the next one,” Mr. Sheehan said.What it all means is debatable. Mr. Ingram and Mr. Sheehan both believe that some form of correction is inevitable as baby boomers complete their exit from the market over the next 10 to 15 years. Their cars aren’t going to disappear, but their ability to spend will.“How Gen-Xers and millennials will value those cars,” Mr. Ingram said, “is the $64,000 question.”Once again, the Federal Reserve has upended markets.Investors had been bracing for the Fed to keep raising interest rates and shrinking its vast portfolio of assets, the equivalent of tapping on the brakes of the United States economy. But this year, the central bank has signaled that it was backing off.Much has been written about the stock market’s joyful reaction to the Fed’s altered approach. But the impact was much broader than that. The central bank’s shift cascaded through markets around the world in ways large and small. Here’s a look at the consequences of the Fed’s new tone.StocksThe Fed’s change of heart helped halt and partly reverse December’s brutal stock sell-off. On Dec. 24, the S&P 500 was down nearly 20 percent from its recent high. After the Fed chairman, Jerome Powell, began on Jan. 4 to espouse the virtues of patience and flexibility, the market turned sharply higher. The S&P 500 is now up about 15 percent from its nadir in December. Stocks of companies that are sensitive to changes in interest rates have climbed at especially speedy clips. Shares of homebuilders, for example, are up more than 17 percent since the market low in December. That suggests the Fed’s shift has been a big reason for the market’s recent pop. “I think the Fed’s turnaround has been vital to the recovery that we’ve seen in equity markets,” said Tony Roth, chief investment officer at the wealth management firm Wilmington Trust. BondsIn December, stress started to build in the market for corporate bonds. Investors balked at putting money in anything other than super-safe government bonds. One sign of this was a widening of “credits spreads” — the difference between the relatively low yields on government bonds and the relatively high yields on corporate bonds. Since Jan. 4, when the Fed’s swivel began, those credit spreads have fallen sharply. That is largely because the yields on corporate bonds have declined, while those on government debt have barely budged. A big reason for the drop in corporate bond yields is that investors have greater confidence in the United States economy and the ability of American companies to remain financially healthy.Currencies One way to think about the short-term interest rates that the Fed sets is that they are the rates at which investors — or even people with savings accounts or certificates of deposits — get paid for holding American dollars. When the Fed raises rates, and other central banks don’t, those higher United States rates attract capital from around the world. The influx of money pushes up the value of the dollar relative to other currencies. Last year, as the Fed raised interest rates four times and appeared ready to continue in 2019, the dollar rose about 10 percent relative to the euro and other major currencies. The rising value of the dollar has big implications. It makes American manufactured goods more expensive, and therefore less competitive, on the world market. It depresses the overseas earnings of American companies when they get converted back into dollars. And it reduces the prices of commodities, many of which are priced in dollars on global markets. (All else being equal, if the dollar’s value rises, you need fewer dollars to buy the same barrel of oil or ton of iron ore.) The rise in the value of the dollar, along with a supply glut in the world’s oil market, helped push crude oil prices down by more than 40 percent from October to the end of December.When the Fed signaled that it was backing off further rate increases, that slowed the upward momentum of the dollar. In fact, it appeared to put a ceiling on the dollar’s rise, at least for now. That, in turn, is likely to help American companies and strengthen commodity prices. Crude oil prices are up 16 percent in 2019.Emerging MarketsA weaker dollar is also a boon to emerging markets, whose economies often rely on exporting commodities and borrowing money from foreign investors. The weak dollar helps on both counts. With higher commodity prices, it becomes easier for commodity-producing countries and companies to pay off loans, which foreign investors often require to be repaid in dollars. This is a reversal of the 2018 trend, in which the strong dollar provoked a run on emerging markets like Turkey and Argentina, causing the value of their currencies to drop. Money now is flooding back to those developing economies, propelling stock markets in Turkey, Russia and Brazil.The FutureThe question is how durable this relief rally will prove. Even with the Fed’s pro-economic-growth stance, there are plenty of remaining risks to the global economy — and therefore to financial markets. Chief among those is the possibility that huge economies in China, Japan and Germany sputter.“The Fed has applied a Band-Aid onto a broken arm,” said Frances Donald, head of macroeconomic strategy at asset manager Manulife in Toronto. “This is enough to give us a moment to alleviate our worst concerns. But it doesn’t solve the underlying problem, which is a sizable growth slowdown.”ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. — Casino profits fell by more than 15% in Atlantic City in 2018, a year in which the downsized market reopened two shuttered gambling halls.The result was a decrease in gross operating profit of 15.4% for the year, to $582 million.Five of Atlantic City's 12 casinos closed between 2014 and 2016, and the market appeared to have stabilized at a smaller level with less competition. But the reopening in June of Revel as the Ocean Resort Casino and the Trump Taj Mahal as the Hard Rock put two new competitors back into the mix.Of the seven casinos that had been operating at the start of last year, five of them saw lower gross operating profits.Only Tropicana and Golden Nugget increased profits last year.A year ago, in the wake of President Trump’s tax cut, euphoric investors pushed the Dow Jones industrial average past 25,000, a record. The Dow had just gained 25 percent in 2017, and the Nasdaq had leapt 28 percent. Volatility was so low that there wasn’t a single day in 2017 when the S&P 500 fluctuated more than 2 percent.Not everyone was celebrating.“If there are any certainties, one will be that this party will eventually come to an end,” James Stack, president of InvesTech Research, told me a year ago. “And when it ends, it will end badly, and with high volatility.”Mr. Stack turned out to be right. He lowered his recommended asset allocation for United States stocks from 82 percent last January to 72 percent in September, when stocks hit new all-time highs. He urged investors to raise cash in October, and at the end of November he recommended an even more defensive posture — including putting money in a fund whose value would rise when stock prices dropped. That brought his recommended net exposure to stocks to just 55 percent, the lowest since the depths of the last bear market in early 2009.Stocks plunged in December, posting their worst monthly loss since the financial crisis and the worst December since 1931 and the Great Depression.Yet most economic indicators are benign. Unemployment is an exceptionally low 3.7 percent. Wages are rising. Inflation remains below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target. The Fed raised rates a quarter point in December, citing “a very healthy economy.”Given Mr. Stack’s track record last year, I reached out to him this week for his current views. Even though valuations have come down and macroeconomic indicators “have remained remarkably strong,” he said, he’s still defensive and hasn’t changed his bearish allocation. He believes that the worst isn’t over and that the Dow and S&P 500 will soon be down 20 percent from their peaks, retreating into a bear market. (The Nasdaq Composite and the Wilshire 2000 index of small-cap stocks are already there.)And that was before a revenue warning from Apple sent markets into another steep fall on Thursday.“A lesson from history is that the market leads the economy by a lot longer than investors realize,” Mr. Stack said. If the economy is headed toward recession, as the latest stock market declines suggest it may be, “we won’t see the first economic warning signs until the first three to five months” of 2019. Among the leading indicators he’s watching for signs of weakness are consumer confidence, housing starts and unemployment claims.On Thursday, the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing index, a leading indicator of industrial activity, fell sharply. That suggests that “serious cracks” are starting to appear in the economy, Mr. Stack said.Mr. Stack is right that bear markets typically precede recessions by many months: CNBC calculated in 2016 that bear markets since World War II had begun on average about eight months before a recession. That means that if a bear market did begin after major indexes peaked last fall, a recession might not start until June or even later. Even then, recessions are often over before economic data confirms their existence.That’s when bear markets are, in fact, followed by recessions, which often isn’t the case. As the economist Paul Samuelson famously said, “The stock market has forecast nine of the last five recessions.”Since World War II, there have been 13 bear markets. They were followed within a year by a recession just seven times. As a predictor of recessions with just 54 percent accuracy, bear markets are little better than flipping a coin.Indeed, Mr. Stack’s data show that two or more down years in a row are quite rare: There have been only four instances since 1928, suggesting that stocks may well be in positive territory by the end of 2019, even if a bear market does materialize in the meantime.Which is one reason the Wharton economist Jeremy Siegel told me that he’s bullish on the stock market this year. He predicts it could rise between 5 percent and 15 percent, even if there is an economic slowdown.Stocks are much cheaper now than they were before the December sell-off. The ratio between stock prices and projected earnings for companies in the S&P 500 is about 17, down from over 19 a year ago and the lowest in the past five years.[Stocks rose Friday after the release of a strong December jobs report and comments by the chairman of the Federal Reserve that the central bank would be flexible on raising interest rates this year.]Mr. Stack, however, argued that in the event of an economic downturn — or even a significant slowdown — “those projected earnings will go out the window.”“I would not call today’s market undervalued,” he added.Mr. Siegel bases his forecast of a market rally on the belief that the Fed will stop raising short-term interest rates. “I think the Fed got the message from the markets that it should not have hiked in December,” he said.Mr. Stack, too, said he was surprised the Fed raised rates in December. “I think the Fed will stand down and put future rate increases on hold,” he said, “which could stabilize the market, at least for the time being.”But Mr. Stack’s technical indicators are still pointing toward a bear market. He’s also worried about the shaky housing market, with price drops and slowing sales showing up in major cities.“We’re not trying to time the market, but we’re very comfortable with our defensive allocation,” he said. Although he predicted higher volatility a year ago, he was nonetheless surprised by the extremes reached in December, without even “a single hard warning sign of recession on the horizon.”“Can you imagine,” he asked, “how volatile it will be when we do have those warnings?”LONDON — Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them.1/BRACE, BRACEThe focus is on the hotly anticipated U.S. results: First-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to fall 2.5 percent on the year in what would be the first quarterly decline since 2016. But revenue is expected to rise 4.8 percent.Those earnings will be crucial to see if the bull market can keep running. Some have argued the Federal Reserve's patience on rate increases this year as well as stock buybacks will add fuel to the S&P's rally. Also boosting the S&P 500 Index are the recent performance of the banks and financials, which had suffered more than the broader market in the fourth quarter, when recession fears scared investors away.First out of the blocks was JPMorgan, which reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit as higher interest income and gains in its advisory and debt underwriting business offset weakness in trading.Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are all scheduled to release their results in days to come. Large banks have indicated that muted capital market activity at the start of the year caused by sluggish trading volumes will be a drag on overall results. Financials are expected to deliver 1.8 percent earnings growth, according to I/B/E/S Refinitiv.Share performance may boil down to valuation. For the next 12 months, Goldman Sachs appears the cheapest, with investors paying $8.30 for every dollar in expected earnings, compared with $11.80 for Bank of New York Mellon.

Chinese GDP data will provide an update on the health of the world's second-largest economy.Dismal March PMIs for the United States and euro zone sent shivers through markets. They were taken as ominous signs for the global economy as international trade tensions hurt factory output.But robust factory data from Beijing offered hope that efforts to shore up China's economy are kicking in, which injected further fuel to the global equity rally.The IHS Markit flash Purchasing Managers' Index due on April 18 should indicate if that optimism was justified -- and if stocks have further upward momentum. China's first-quarter GDP data is out on April 17.Many investors say low expectations for first-quarter earnings, dovish central bank policies and hopes for Chinese stimulus and a trade truce between Washington and Beijing are largely priced into equity markets. With all that baked in and investors still scrambling for consensus on what happens over the rest of 2019, there's a lot riding on that data. - Euro zone business growth worse than expected in March -PMI- China March factory activity grows for first time in 4 months, but exports weak - In foreboding sign for U.S. economy, factory sector softens (Graphic: PMI services, https://tmsnrt.rs/2X3sX04)(Graphic: PMI manufacturing, https://tmsnrt.rs/2VEEWR9)3/TRY-ING TIMES For all the relief in emerging markets that the Federal Reserve doesn't expect to raise interest rates anytime soon and that commodity prices are hot again, there are still the troublesome twosome: The Turkish lira and Argentine peso.The peso has slumped to fresh lows in the past 10 days, although the International Monetary Fund's unlocking a $10.8 billion tranche of funds helped the battered currency to regain some of its footing.Meanwhile, nine weeks of losses in the last 10 have the lira sliding back towards six to the dollar, the level that set alarm bells ringing last year.Ankara's economic reform plans -- announced on Wednesday -- failed to impress markets and investor meetings with Finance Minister Berat Albayrak at the IMF and World Bank spring meetings did little to change that. Ankara's row with Washington over plans to buy a Russian missile defence system and declines in its FX reserves have only added to the concern of investors still smarting from last month's pre-election move to temporarily freeze the London lira market. - BREAKINGVIEWS-Argentina's Macri may yet survive his own policies- Turkey's Albayrak leaves investors unconvinced in Washington -sources - POLL-Turkey's economy to contract in 2019, longer recession ahead (Graphic: Lira volatility, https://tmsnrt.rs/2X4U1vO)4/POLLS, PINS AND NEEDLESThe world's largest and third-largest democracies are going to the polls.

India's elections are spread over seven phases and 39 days.Both countries face similar issues around anti-incumbency and flailing economic growth. Betting on continuity, investors have pumped money into their markets, driving up bonds and stocks.Polls in Indonesia suggest President Joko Widodo, or Jokowi, who faces his opponent from 2014 once again, will not only win re-election but will also emerge with a stronger coalition. Indonesian markets have also always scored well in election years.So it's India that investors should be sweating over.

Imported from Japan or the Middle East, they offer an affordable route to vehicle ownership in Kenya and have dominated the market for decades. That is an obstacle big carmakers must overcome if they are to crack Africa, a market promising rapid growth as trade tensions threaten sales elsewhere. African consumers also still need conventional engines just as demand in more traditional markets is curbed by restrictions on carbon emissions.Volkswagen, BMW, Toyota, Nissan and others have joined forces to lobby governments for steps that would reduce the imports that have made sub-Saharan Africa notoriously difficult terrain and allow local production to flourish. "The question on Africa isn't, 'Is it a market of the future?'" Mike Whitfield, Nissan's top executive for Africa, told Reuters. "It's a case of when." Four years after forming the Association of African Automotive Manufacturers (AAAM) their efforts are starting to bear fruit. Carmakers that set up local assembly plants could get tax holidays of up to 10 years and duty exemptions in Nigeria, Kenya and Ghana, according to government plans seen by Reuters. Thomas Schaefer, who heads Volkswagen's Africa business, said there is a potential market in sub-Saharan Africa for 3 to 4 million new cars, up from just 420,000 in 2017. But that will require addressing the well-entrenched interests of second-hand car dealers, smugglers and lowering the price of new cars. "It will largely depend on how successful the African governments are in limiting the amounts of second-hand imports and how price-competitive new vehicles can be with their tariffs," said Craig Parker, Africa research director at Frost & Sullivan, a U.S.-based market research firm. MULTIPLYING EFFECTSAfrica's population and household incomes are rising rapidly. But its 1 billion inhabitants account for only 1 percent of the world's new passenger car sales, industry data shows. South Africans bought over 85 percent of those vehicles. The AAAM identified Kenya, Nigeria and Ghana as potential manufacturing hubs and helped draft legislation setting up standards and incentives.Details of governments' plans provided to Reuters demonstrate that African nations are keen to secure a spot as a beachhead for the industry. Nigeria and Ghana are preparing to offer automakers tax holidays of up to 10 years and duty-free imports of parts and components used in local assembly. Nigeria also plans to double the levy on new, fully-built imported vehicles to 70 percent to boost demand for locally produced cars, though the policy's approval has been delayed. In Kenya, automakers will pay no import or excise duties and get a 50-percent corporate tax break. For African nations facing massive demographic pressures, such concessions make sense if they create jobs, said Jelani Aliyu, of Nigeria's National Automotive Design and Development Council. "The multiplying effects are exponential," said Aliyu, who foresees supporting industries developing around the plants. Legislative and fiscal frameworks are being finalised, but companies are already investing millions of dollars in new plants. VW and Nissan have set up operations in Nigeria, Kenya and Ghana or have pledged to do so. Honda and Peugeot have launched assembly plants in Nigeria, and Peugeot has done the same in Kenya. Carmakers sorely need the business. Their South African divisions, which typically direct operations elsewhere on the continent, face stagnating domestic sales and scant growth prospects in their main export market, Europe. A chaotic Brexit or U.S. tariff hikes could further dampen sales.Toyota South Africa's chief executive Andrew Kirby said the strategy is: "Focus on Africa because Africa is going to grow significantly." A pivot to Africa could also help insulate automakers from the immediate effects of the electric vehicle revolution. The continent is ill-placed to join it at the moment due to the higher prices of EVs and unreliable power grids. Just 66 electric cars were sold last year in South Africa - the continent's most developed economy."Africa will most likely remain as the last bastion of internal combustion engines," Parker said. DISTORTED MARKETNevertheless, industry officials say the biggest hurdle to developing the market for new cars is dumping from countries such as Japan, where strict vehicle inspections force cars out of circulation after just a few years. They say this distorts the market by allowing dealers to buy the cars at scrap prices and export them to Africa.They blame the cheap imports for killing off assembly sectors in a number of African countries including Nigeria, which built around 150,000 cars per year until the 1980s.Political will is needed to change that, and without it there is little point in considering a country for local production, according to VW's Schaefer. "The markets ... are literally not functioning right now due to importation of used vehicles," he said.In Kenya, the government plans to wind down imports of cars more than three years old by 2021. Exceptions will be made for passenger vehicles with 1.5 litre or smaller engines. The policy could see mid-range imported models double in price, according to the 300-member Kenya Auto Bazaar Association (KABA). The lobby group has taken out ads in local newspapers denouncing the policy and is demanding a meeting with Kenya's president. Mark Oburu, KABA's vice-chairman, said the move would hit an industry that delivers 85 percent of Kenyan car purchases."The middle class will not be able to own a vehicle of their choice," he said. In the Nairobi bazaar, Grace was shopping for her eldest son's first car. She said she could not afford to buy a new one. "If they don't rescind that decision, we will be on boda bodas (motor-bikes)."Both Ghana and Nigeria have also pledged to tackle the issue. Nigeria hiked taxes on imported used cars in 2014, but smuggling has undermined that effort to boost demand for local production, according to manufacturers and government officials. Used cars are also among the leading imports in many African countries, and governments will have to wean themselves off the associated tax revenues.There are other stumbling blocks: access to financing is limited, and countries that don't host assembly plants must also be persuaded to limit used imports and reduce tariffs on African-made vehicles. That will be hard to do if the only outcome they see is higher sticker prices."The purpose is not to take the most lucrative slice of the industry," said Ghana's minister of trade and industry, Alan Kyerematen, suggesting that neighbours could produce components for his country's assembly plants.

The correlation between USD/CNY and Chinese government bonds is also low. These features render CNY bonds a good avenue for portfolio diversification, especially when initial exposure is low for many investors," she said.Data from Bond Connect, which gives foreign investors access to China's interbank market, shows trading volumes through the scheme jumped 70 percent, and the number of registered Bond Connect investors rose 41 percent, in the first quarter of 2019.Bond Connect says index inclusion has shifted the focus of trading towards government and policy bank bonds, which accounted for 66 percent of turnover in March, up from 37 percent in December.But following a year-long rally that pushed yields on 10-year Chinese government bonds down nearly a full percentage point from highs in late January 2018, some investors may be seeing less room for profit, said Bajaj.A lack of familiarity with Chinese bonds may also deter some foreign investors, while technical issues such as limited hedging tools and patchy trading of newly issued government bonds remain nagging concerns."I imagine a lot of investors in similar positions like myself have just kind of a lack of experience of the market that probably limits its global safe-haven flow," said Ross Hutchison, a global bond fund manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Edinburgh.

(Reporting by Daniel Leussink and Andrew Galbraith; Additional reporting by Vidya Ranganathan in SINGAPORE; Editing by Lincoln Feast)WASHINGTON — Top finance officials from emerging market economies on Thursday called for a collective global response to resolve ongoing trade tensions within a rules-based trading system.In a communique from finance ministers of the so-called Group of 24, a bloc of emerging and developing market nations, officials said: "International trade has delivered enormous benefits globally and has been an important engine of growth among G24 countries."The group, which issued the communique during the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington, said it stood ready to cooperate in the effort to build "a modern, open, rules-based, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system."Trade disputes, particularly the one between the United States and China, have been blamed as a key driver behind the recent downshift in global growth.A looming auto tariff war would hit the global economy harder than the U.S.-China spat, according to the IMF's chief economist Gita Gopinath.The G24 called on a global strengthening of support for developing countries' struggle to deal with debt and the challenge that it poses to economic growth.At the same time, it resurfaced a previously sought idea of using the Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), a basket of the dollar, euro, yen, pound, and yuan - and the de-facto currency of the IMF - as a more active reserve currency. The group called for stronger international cooperation to "recover and return stolen assets and repatriate and prosecute fugitive offenders" and also for increased transparency and a tougher stance against corruption. (Reporting by Rodrigo Campos; Editing by Paul Simao)ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — At least 16 people were killed when a powerful bomb ripped through a vegetable market in Quetta in southwestern Pakistan early Friday, officials said. At least nine of the dead were Hazaras, a Shiite Muslim minority group that has repeatedly been the target of Sunni extremists.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, which also injured at least 30 people, some of them critically. But Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a banned militant Sunni group, has often carried out attacks against Hazaras in Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan Province.For years, the Hazaras have lived in a state of perpetual fear in Quetta, and promises made by successive governments have failed to ensure their safety.While terrorist attacks have declined significantly in the past year across the country, the attack on Friday was a grim reminder that the Hazaras continue to remain vulnerable to militant violence and that the security provided to them remains inadequate. Quetta has a large presence of security forces and a vast network of intelligence operatives.A senior police official said the bomb went off in a sack of potatoes, and that the victims included shopkeepers and customers at the vegetable market. One paramilitary soldier was also killed, and officials said they feared the death toll would increase.The police said they were investigating whether a remote control or a timed device had set off the bomb. The police initially ruled out an attack carried out by a suicide bomber, but investigators said Friday evening that such a scenario seemed probable as they had found human remains that could not be identified.Abdul Razzaq Cheema, a senior police official, said that people belonging to the Hazara group come daily in a convoy to the vegetable market from Hazara Town, a walled enclave on the outskirts of Quetta, and that they are provided with security. The bomb that went off Friday morning ignited while vegetables were being loaded during the early market rush.Qadir Ali, a provincial lawmaker who is Hazara, said in an interview that apprehension among Hazaras had increased since the bombing.At least 250,000 Hazara people live in Hazara Town, and each day many vehicles made the trip to and from the vegetable market that was attacked, Mr. Ali said.He urged the government to increase security, and said that he thought the attack was intended “to create tensions between different ethnicities living in Quetta.”“In recent months, Hazara people had started feeling safer and started commuting to different parts of the city,” he said. “But the bombing today seems an attempt to force us into isolation.”The attack was widely condemned by government officials and rights groups.“This horrific loss of life is a painful reminder of the threats that Quetta’s Hazara community continues to face,” Amnesty International said in a statement. “Each time, there are promises that more will be done to protect them, and each time those promises have failed to materialize.”One by one, the concerns that have hung over the stock market have faded. Fears that the United States economy would dip into a recession this year have eased. The Federal Reserve seems to be finished raising interest rates for the foreseeable future, and optimism has increased that the United States and China could end their trade war.But if the January snap back (it was the best start to a year for stocks in decades, after the worst December for stocks in an even longer period) is to sustain itself, big technology companies likely will have to lead the way. So far this year, they have not done that. For much of the past decade, the fate of the stock market has been tied to the performance of a handful of the largest tech companies: Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft and Netflix led the market from one record to the next.By the end of August, their sway over the direction of the S&P 500 exceeded all but two of the index’s 11 sector groupings. As the index pushed to a record high last summer, the rise in those six companies’ shares accounted for half of its gain. They led on the way down too, dragging the broader market lower over the final three months of 2018 and nearly ending the longest bull market on record.So it’s notable, then, that as the S&P 500 rallied nearly 8 percent in January, the big technology stocks accounted for just 17 percent of the benchmark’s rise, according to data from Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices. What happened? The companies have faced a fundamental question since late last year: Could they continue to pull in new users and generate more sales in a slowing global economy? Sales growth had begun to slow in the second half of 2018 and earnings updates in January haven’t fully resolved investors’ concerns about their trajectory. “This is the first quarter in my memory that technology has on the whole had worse metrics than the S&P 500,” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, referring to the earnings and revenue growth rate of big technology companies.After Apple warned of diminishing demand for new iPhones in China earlier this year, its forecast for the current quarter wasn’t as dire as many on Wall Street had feared. The stock has gained 7.7 percent since then. Still, the iPhone maker reported a 15 percent drop in revenue, including a 27 percent decline in China, and its results indicated a difficult road ahead. Its stock remains nearly 30 percent below its peak.Amazon reported record profits and revenue. But its shares were down 5.4 percent Friday in part because revenue from online shopping slowed and the growth of Prime memberships appeared to have plateaued.Microsoft shares have fallen 3.4 percent since it reported on Wednesday. Revenue at the software giant has surged in recent years as its bet on cloud computing has paid off, but there were continued signs that that acceleration could be tapering off.Facebook, whose shares were the most battered among the big tech companies last year, was perhaps the bright spot this earnings season. Despite a string of scandals, the social network generated record revenue and profit last year. Its shares have jumped 10.5 percent since Wednesday.Netflix also said revenue would grow more slowly this quarter. Its stock is down almost 3.8 percent since it reported on Jan. 17.There is a big caveat to all the hand-wringing about slowing growth: All five companies still generate huge revenue. And should Beijing and Washington reach an agreement in the trade war, sales could pick up if the global economy, particularly China’s, begins to gain speed. “There was real concern that tech was the canary in the coal mine of what would be a very dark 2019,” said Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities covering technology companies. “Thus far a lot of those fears are proving overblown. That could set the stage for tech to make new highs this year, depending on what happens with China.”After the wrenching swings of late 2018 and early January, it was difficult to harbor many illusions about the stock market. It became clear that investing in stocks wasn’t easy, predictable or safe, at least in the short run. If you weren’t a risk taker or deeply committed for the long term, it was difficult to look at the market closely and remain calm.In fact, the long bull market had a near-death experience in December. Based on intraday trading, stocks descended just below the 20 percent-loss threshold that customarily denotes the birth of a bear market. Counting only prices at the market close, however, the Dow Jones industrial average didn’t quite fall into that dismal territory. Still, despite a market rise in January, losses have been severe, especially in sectors that had been highfliers, like technology. What’s an investor to do?

The figures could add to a debate within the so-called OPEC+ group of producers on whether to maintain oil supply cuts beyond June. A Russian official indicated this week Moscow wanted to pump more, although OPEC has been saying the curbs must remain.OPEC, Russia and other non-member producers are reducing output by 1.2 million bpd from Jan. 1 for six months. The producers are due to meet on June 25-26 to decide whether to extend the pact. One of the key Russian officials to foster the pact with OPEC, Kirill Dmitriev, signaled on Monday that Russia wanted to raise output when it meets OPEC in June because of improving market conditions and falling stockpiles.OPEC+ returned to supply cuts in 2019 out of concern that slowing economic growth and demand would lead to a new supply glut. OPEC's report said the economic backdrop was weakening and lowered its estimate of global growth in demand by 30,000 bpd to 1.21 million bpd."Newly available data has confirmed the recently observed downward trend in global economic activities," the report said.In a development that will ease OPEC concern about a new glut, the report also said inventories in developed economies fell in February, after rising in January.Stocks in February exceeded the five-year average - a yardstick OPEC watches closely - by 7.5 million barrels, less than in January.The report suggests that if OPEC kept pumping at March's rate it would slightly undersupply the world market in 2019, even with the lower demand outlook.For a graphic on World oil market balance 2019, see - https://tmsnrt.rs/2VBfVGG VENEZUELA OUTPUT SLIDESVenezuela's production figure brings its numbers closer to outside estimates, which have been saying the country's economic collapse has taken a bigger toll on its oil industry. Output in Venezuela, once a top-three OPEC producer, has been declining for years due to economic collapse. In March, supply dropped due to U.S. sanctions on state oil company PDVSA designed to oust President Nicolas Maduro, and power blackouts.Venezuela, plus Iran and Libya, were exempted from making voluntary curbs under the OPEC+ deal, on the basis that their output would probably fall anyway.OPEC's share of the cut is 800,000 bpd from in most cases October 2018 levels, and other figures in the report showed producers were removing far more than agreed.The group uses two sets of figures to monitor its output — figures provided by each country and by secondary sources that include industry media. This is a legacy of old disputes over how much countries were really pumping.Overall OPEC output fell by a further 534,000 bpd to 30.022 million bpd, according to the secondary-source figures. This was led not by Venezuela but by Saudi Arabia, which has voluntarily cut supply by more than it agreed to support the market.As a result, the 11 OPEC members required to cut output achieved 155 percent compliance in March with pledged curbs, according to a Reuters calculation, up from February.OPEC estimates that it needs to provide an average of 30.30 million bpd in 2019 to balance the market, a figure lowered by 160,000 bpd month-on-month partly due to weaker demand. Even so, the report indicates there will be a small 2019 deficit if OPEC keeps pumping at March's rate of just over 30 million bpd and other things remain equal. Last month's report had indicated a small surplus.

"The skid marks in the Chinese car market will be seen again this year," Stefan Hartung on Monday said, adding that China's auto market saw a double-digit decline in the first quarter of 2019.Hartung said he was optimistic about sales in the company's biggest foreign market in the medium and long term due to China's still low saturation level of private vehicles, adding that a stabilisation was possible.He said mobility services such as car-sharing and shuttle-services would grow faster in China than in the U.S. or Europe.Bosch's sales in China in 2018 rose by just one percent, after a 25-percent rise the year before.  (Reporting by Ilona Wissenbach; writing by Riham Alkousaa; Editing by Tassilo Hummel and Kirsten Donovan)Millions of investors will receive year-end statements from their brokerages and retirement plan managers in the coming weeks, and the great majority of them will have unpleasant news: losses.The S&P 500 finished the year down 6.2 percent, with the steepest declines recorded in the fourth quarter. With Apple’s announcement of disappointing sales in China on Wednesday, the bad times for stocks continued in the first week of the new year. While most economic data has remained strong, there are some rumblings that 2019 may be quite a bit rougher than 2018. Corporate executives are becoming more pessimistic, according to surveys, and Americans are conducting Google searches for the word “recession” at the highest rate since the last one just ended in 2009.If it all makes you want to flee — or at least shift your 401(k) into cash — that’s understandable. It’s also a bad idea.The sensible response to this unnerving series of developments is to do pretty much anything else. Read a book. Go for a walk. Take up knitting. Or just do nothing at all, like take a nap. If you are a long-term investor (and any money you have tied up in the stock market should be intended for the long term to begin with), tumult like that of the last few months isn’t something that should cause panic. Rather, it’s the price you pay for enjoying returns that, over long time horizons, are likely to be substantially higher than those for cash or bonds.That’s true if this episode turns out to be a false alarm for the overall economy, as is a distinct possibility. But it’s also true even if this does turn out to be the start of a prolonged period of economic and market distress — especially if you are still in the phase of your life of contributing to a retirement plan or otherwise accumulating savings.ImageNapping at a brokerage office in Beijing in October.CreditJason Lee/ReutersThe recent pessimistic tone in markets is getting way ahead of the evidence. Nothing so far in either the economic data or the market indicators that most reliably predict economic swings suggests there will be anything worse than a modest slowdown in economic growth in 2019.Businesses are still expanding and adding jobs. The yield on two-year Treasury bonds has fallen in the last three months, but it would have fallen a lot more if the bond market — which tends to be closely tied to the direction of the overall economy — had been predicting an imminent recession.Moreover, an investor who moved money into cash now would be doing so just as the valuation of stocks was becoming more favorable — buying high and selling low, not the way great fortunes are made. That’s especially true when you factor in the drop in longer-term interest rates, which makes shares particularly appealing relative to bonds.In early November, investing $100 in stocks would buy you about $4.64 worth of corporate earnings, versus the $3.21 in interest you would could receive by investing in 10-year Treasury bonds. Now, stocks offer $5.25, while bonds offer only $2.61.But most important, even if the economic road ahead really is as bumpy as some in markets seem to fear, you’re probably not going to be successful at timing those swings just right.Of course, if you had a perfect ability to predict how far the market would fall and when it would bottom out, it would make sense to move money in and out. You do not.There is a wide range of evidence that people are pitiful at timing the market. Even supposed investment experts lack that prescience. Even if you turned out to be right about a continuing tumble in 2019, the great risk would be that whenever the rebound began, you would be caught out of position, unable to take advantage.Suppose you were clever enough to recognize at the start of December 2007 that a major recession was about to take place, and you moved your money out of stocks.Yes, you would have saved yourself from steep losses in 2008 and early 2009. But you have to ask yourself: Would I have also had the courage to put money back in while the economy was still in horrendous shape in 2009, with double-digit unemployment and a banking system in tatters?If not then, when would you have moved money back in? People who simply left their savings fully invested in the stock market in December 2007 have now made a 134 percent return on that money. Would you have done better than that, or would you have missed out on a big chunk of those gains out of the same caution that led you to pull money out of stocks to begin with?People who did not panic in the fall of 2008 — the most panic-worthy time in most of our lifetimes — and kept putting their retirement funds into stocks did indeed incur steep losses over the ensuing months. But their newly invested funds were being put into stocks at the most favorable valuations in a generation, and thus enjoyed the full benefit of the rebound when it eventually came. A truism of economic and financial cycles is that by the time it feels like the coast is clear and putting money into riskier investments is completely safe, the real money has already been made. People who looked at the economic chaos of early 2009 and stuck to their guns have ended up far better off than those who, convinced that a double-dip downturn was imminent, waited for years to get in.This equation changes, of course, if we’re talking about money needed imminently as opposed to longer-term savings, such as for retirement. The economy looks stable now, but that could change — it’s still possible that markets and C.E.O.s know something about the future that isn’t clear in the data yet.But that’s more of a fundamental argument about how your assets should be allocated. If an 18 percent drop in stocks is enough to cause you to change your entire investment strategy, that money shouldn’t have been in stocks to begin with.The entire point of investing in stocks is that you get greater long-term expected returns in exchange for tolerating bigger ups and downs. Episodes like those of the last few weeks are, in effect, the price you pay for returns that are substantially higher than bonds or cash over longer periods. Just as there are no free lunches, there are no excess returns without some volatility and risk.As individual investors, we cannot control volatility. What we can control is our own mind-set and reaction, and the more level your head, the better your long-term results are likely to be.ZURICH — Swiss eyecare company Alcon made its debut on the SIX Swiss Exchange on Tuesday with a market capitalisation of more than $25 billion after a shareholder spin-off from drugmaker Novartis, the Alpine nation's biggest stock deal in a decade.Alcon shares traded at 57.80 Swiss francs at 0800 GMT after opening at 55 Swiss francs per share, reaching a market cap of some 28 billion Swiss francs (21.46 billion pounds). Novartis shares, which closed on Tuesday at 95 francs, fell to 85.50 francs. Investors got one Alcon share for each five Novartis shares they held. Alcon, a $7.1 billion-per-year group which began as a Fort Worth, Texas, pharmacy in 1945, suffered flagging sales and profit before Novartis swapped out management in 2016 to help arrest the decline. Geneva-based Alcon now aims to strengthen its rank as the biggest ophthalmic surgery device maker and No. 2 maker of contact lenses and solutions behind Johnson & Johnson. "We are poised to achieve sustainable growth and create long-term shareholder value as a standalone company," Alcon Chief Executive David Endicott said. Giving Alcon to shareholders helps cap Novartis's years-long retreat from being a broad healthcare company, as Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan focuses on prescription drugs and specialised, costly treatments like gene therapy. "We continue to reimagine ourselves as a leading medicines company powered by breakthrough medicines, data science and advanced therapy platforms," Narasimhan said in a statement.  (Reporting by John Miller, editing by John Revill and Michael Shields)You may not have appreciated it at the time — golden eras have a habit of coming and going like that — but a five-year stretch that started in 2013 was a pretty great time to buy a washing machine. Inflation for home laundry equipment, as measured by the Labor Department, fell steadily during that time, which meant you could buy the same washer your neighbor bought last year for less money. Or you could buy a better one at the same price. Great news for your clothes, though maybe bad news for your friendship, if your neighbor was the covetous type. That stretch of laundry deflation ended last year, shortly after President Trump imposed tariffs, starting at 20 percent, on imported washers. The move was a response to a complaint filed by Whirlpool, a Michigan-based manufacturer. The company has long dominated the washing machine business — many Americans have had Whirlpools in their laundry rooms for decades — but has recently faced stiffer competition from foreign manufacturers. Whirlpool claimed that foreign competitors like LG and Samsung were flooding the appliance market with washing machines from South Korea and Mexico at prices so low that they were hurting American makers. As an effort to help domestic producers, the tariffs worked — very briefly. Whirlpool added 200 jobs at its factory in Clyde, Ohio. Its stock price jumped $20 per share in the first few days after the tariffs took effect. Then things went bad.A year after Mr. Trump announced the tariffs, washing machine prices were up, as many analysts had expected. But that has not been a boon to the makers of washers because fewer Americans are investing in new laundry equipment, exposing how protectionist trade policies can backfire on the very companies they are meant to safeguard. Tariffs of two varieties have pushed prices upThe washer-specific tariffs raised costs for importers like LG and Samsung. But another tariff issued by Mr. Trump, on imported steel, raised costs for some domestic manufacturers like Whirlpool, which took those companies by surprise. Many manufacturers passed those higher costs on to consumers. Once stores worked their way through models that had been imported before tariffs hit, deflation gave way to sharp price increases. After years of steady growth, sales reversed in 2018A basic rule of economics is that when the price of something goes up, people buy less of it. That’s just what happened to washing machines.Data from the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers shows that shipments of washing machines increased by an average of 5 percent a year from 2015 to 2017. Last year, shipments fell 3 percent.Retailers saw that reaction in real time. “We have seen, as you mentioned, tariffs’ impact in laundry,” Craig Menear, the chairman and chief executive of the Home Depot, told analysts on an earnings call in November.Retailers were hurt, but manufacturers were hurt more Washing machines make up a small slice of Home Depot’s business. They’re more important for Whirlpool, Samsung and other manufacturers — and the stocks of those businesses have been hammered this year. Laundry appliances made up nearly 30 percent of Whirlpool’s sales in 2017. The company’s shares gave up their initial gains after the tariffs were announced, and then fell some more.Through the third quarter, Whirlpool’s unit sales were down 2.5 percent in North America, compared with the same period in its previous fiscal year. The company’s executives said in an October earnings call that they expected to be hit by an additional $300 million in cost increases, largely driven by the steel tariff, in the year to come. A Whirlpool spokesman declined to comment, citing a company policy not to talk about continuing trade issues. But the company confirmed it did, in fact, add 200 employees in Ohio.Things should get better in 2019Mr. Trump’s tariff rate on washing machines will drop two percentage points, to 18 percent, this year, which should mildly ease the pressure on companies and consumers. Retailers say they have seen signs that suggest the worst is over: Ted Decker, executive vice president for merchandising at Home Depot, told analysts in November that after several difficult months with washing machines, “our laundry sales and unit productivity is on par, if not slightly better, than the average of our overall appliance business.”The three-month average for laundry equipment inflation peaked in July, at 20 percent. In December, that increase was just 1.6 percent. This makes sense, economically: Tariffs jolted prices upward, but the overall trend in the appliance industry remains downward. If your neighbor bought a new washer last June and you buy the same one this June, there’s a decent chance it will be cheaper.You might not even need to wait that long. Retail websites suggest that if you run out to your local appliance store this weekend, you’re likely to find a bunch of washing machines, American made and imported, on sale. The momentum behind the American economy is strong. In 2018, unemployment hit its lowest rate in 49 years, 3.7 percent. Real wages were (finally) increasing and inflation remained muted. In 2019, growth is projected to slow but still remain above 2 percent.Yet risks abound. The trade war and the escalating drama over the government shutdown threaten growth. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve’s inaugural Financial Stability Report, an early warning system for the financial markets, recently highlighted the vulnerabilities created by investors who show a “high tolerance for risk-taking” in the market for corporate debt. The economy’s continued health will hinge on whether big Wall Street banks can withstand shocks caused by these or other threats and continue lending.On this front, it is far from certain that banks and their regulators are prepared.Years of low interest rates have brought about excessive business debt and elevated prices for corporate bonds. The corporate bond market has swelled to nearly $7 trillion. The debt owed by businesses as a percentage of gross domestic product is at a record high. But the credit quality of investment-grade bonds has deteriorated. Underwriting standards on “leveraged loans” to risky companies have eroded. And until recently, yields on junk debt remained low, a sign that investors are too willing to take on the risk of bonds held by companies with less-than-stellar credit.These vulnerabilities can amplify shocks and create systemic disruptions. In a market downturn, widespread downgrades of corporate bonds could induce a sell-off, precipitating sharp declines in the price of bonds and feeding a cycle of further downgrades, margin calls and sell-offs. Highly leveraged corporations may have difficulty refinancing or getting more credit, increasing the risk of corporate defaults and bankruptcies.Cracks are already forming. In December, borrowing in the high-yield bond market came to a standstill. Deals in the leveraged loan market are also delayed from a lack of interest from mutual funds and collateralized loan obligation managers, the largest buyers of leveraged loans. These events signal trouble ahead for highly indebted companies seeking more financing.This instability raises a basic question: Are the big banks strong enough to handle it? The Fed seems to think they are. The banks are better capitalized than before the 2008 financial crisis, and stress tests show they can withstand steep declines in prices of assets that they hold. But the Fed may be overly optimistic.Wall Street banks have significant exposure to corporate debt. They underwrite and make markets in corporate bonds, make leveraged loans, invest in collateralized loan obligations, extend credit to businesses, including highly leveraged hedge funds, and buy and sell protection on corporate debt in the credit default swap market.In a crisis, these exposures could serve as a channel for contagion in a highly interconnected financial system dominated by large banks.Yet bank stress tests don’t adequately capture this dynamic. Stress tests don’t consider how a firm’s response to a shock can reverberate. They also understate the effect of financial-sector distress on the economy. This helps explain why the tests have allowed bank capital to decline slightly despite elevated asset prices and increasingly stringent scenarios.Stress tests also rely primarily on risk-based capital ratios, which vary based on the perceived riskiness of a bank’s assets. These ratios are routinely gamed and, as we learned in 2008, are a poor indicator of a firm’s financial health. A more credible yardstick is the supplementary leverage ratio, which is a simple cap on the percentage of a bank’s funding from debt. But based on recent remarks by senior Fed officials, its role in stress testing may be eliminated altogether.To be sure, reforms put in place after the 2008 financial crisis have enhanced bank resilience. The eight global systemically important banks in the United States now abide by additional capital and liquidity requirements, including a surcharge intended to ensure they absorb the effects of their own failure without disrupting the broader economy. But here, too, there are deficiencies. In calculating the surcharge, the Fed relies on incomplete historical data that ignore losses that taxpayer bailouts averted in the last crisis. These deficiencies don’t inspire confidence.Recessions that emerge from distress in the financial sector tend to run deeper and last longer than other recessions. As the former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker recently warned, the danger comes from “standing by while bubbles and excesses threaten financial markets.”So far, regulators appear to be doing exactly that — or worse.In recent months, regulators have proposed to reduce liquidity buffers of banks with as much as $700 billion in assets, dilute the strength and frequency of stress tests, water down the Volcker Rule prohibition on risky trading and cut leverage capital requirements for corporate derivatives exposures. Pressed by lobbyists and others, regulators are now contemplating a further weakening of the surcharge on the eight systemically important banks.To prevent a repeat of 2008, regulators must look beyond the concerns of bank lobbyists. Instead of cutting capital to increase shareholder returns or making it easier to bail out giant financial institutions the next time around, regulators must address threats to the economy. This means requiring thicker capital cushions for the big banks and tighter leveraged loan underwriting standards. These steps would help secure a safer financial system and possibly avoid another crisis.Sheila C.

In fact, it might have brought more Chinese companies to Wall Street.Tencent Music’s trading debut on the New York Stock Exchange in December capped a wave of Chinese companies going public in the United States. In total, 33 Chinese firms raised $9.2 billion through initial public offerings on American exchanges — up 140 percent from 2017 and the highest level since 2014, according to Dealogic.Of course, 2014 comes with an asterisk of sorts. Alibaba went public in September that year, raising $25 billion. Subtract the value of Alibaba’s offering and Chinese firms raised just $3 billion that year.Last year, however, offerings from Chinese firms dominated the United States market for initial public offerings. The three largest I.P.O.s by market value were Chinese companies. And Chinese firms accounted for four of the 10 largest such offerings in 2018 ranked by amount raised on American exchanges, the most of any country, including the United States, according to Dealogic.Why list in America?American exchanges offer prestige and a broader investor base that Chinese entrepreneurs can find attractive. The United States also offers a quicker route to the public markets. While Chinese regulators have taken steps to reduce the long wait, it still takes 18 months or longer for shares to begin trading from the time a company files to go public. That compares with just 42 days to list in the United States, according to Dealogic.But the trade war may also have been a factor.A slowing Chinese economy and escalating trade tensions dragged down markets in Hong Kong and China before stocks in the United States turned seriously wobbly. At their lows in late October, the Hang Seng stock index and the benchmark stock indexes in Shenzhen and Shanghai were down 15 percent to 35 percent for the year. By comparison, the S & P 500 was still up 2.5 percent at that point, making it far more attractive for offerings.The economic uncertainty that roiled the stock market at the end of 2018 hurt Citigroup’s trading business, the bank said on Monday, as a busy week of quarterly earnings reports by the country’s largest banks got off to a shaky start.Citi said it had almost a half-billion dollars less in revenue in the year’s fourth quarter than analysts had expected. The cause of the drop, the bank said, was an unexpectedly sharp decline in revenue from trading in government bonds, foreign currencies and other fixed income products as falling stock prices spooked investors.Investors have fretted for the past several months over the Federal Reserve’s next moves and President Trump’s unpredictable trade tariff announcements. Those concerns are not likely to dissipate, and Citi’s chief executive, Michael Corbat, said they could eventually be more of a drag on the economy than actual policy changes.“Right now, we see the biggest risk in the global economy as one of talking ourselves into a recession,” Mr. Corbat said in a conference call with analysts.Still, Citi warned that monetary and trade policies could affect its performance in the future.The bank’s chief financial officer, John Gerspach, said in a call with reporters that continuing uncertainty about how various countries’ central banks will carry out plans to drain excess cash from the global financial system and about the Trump administration’s protracted trade war with China risked hurting the American economy in the second half of this year or early in 2020.Citi recorded $17.1 billion in revenue for the quarter, compared with the $17.6 billion expected by analysts. The deficit did not indicate major problems for the bank, but it showed that, however vague, investors’ worries about the future can have a measurable impact on a big corporation’s results.[Read more about the key factors affecting stocks and the economy.]Furious activity in the financial markets can sometimes help companies that are close to Wall Street by generating more business for them, but Citi’s clients opted to hold tight as stocks began to drop in September, Mr. Gerspach said.“Clients — investors and corporate clients — waited on the sidelines,” he said.Citi customers, Mr. Gerspach said, did not ask the bank to make many trades on their behalf because they were “waiting for clearer market conditions” that never came.“In December, they got worse,” he said.As a result, Citi’s fixed income trading revenue for the fourth quarter was down 21 percent from the same period a year earlier and 39 percent below the results for the third quarter of 2018.The bank’s performance in other areas was solid. Loans and deposits ticked up again, and Citi said the administration’s corporate tax cuts had been slightly better for its balance sheet than originally estimated. Citi shares were up nearly 4 percent in trading Monday.Citigroup was the first of the country’s major banks to report fourth-quarter results. JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo will issue their reports on Tuesday, with Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley set to do so on Wednesday.Good Thursday morning. Want this by email?

A significant slowdown in iPhone sales in China forced the company to reduce revenue expectations for its most recent quarter. The company said yesterday that it expected revenue of about $84 billion in the quarter that ended Dec. 29, down from a previous estimate of $89 billion to $93 billion.It was the first time Apple had lowered its quarterly forecast in 16 years. The NYT’s Jack Nicas and Keith Bradsher write:“Apple’s surprise announcement added to concerns about the ability of American tech giants to navigate an increasingly uncertain economy and a continuing trade war between the United States and China. China has become Apple’s third-largest market in recent years, driven mostly by iPhone sales.”Apple’s announcement is the latest warning from corporate America about the impact of the trade war, which may be harder to defend now that the collateral damage includes one of the country’s most recognizable brands. Companies like FedEx and Starbucks are already struggling in China. And other American businesses, especially tech players and Detroit automakers, could suffer as well.More: The optimistic narrative about Apple’s iPhone business is falling apart, writes Bloomberg Opinion’s Shira Ovide.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________Markets prepare for a drop as the bears re-emergeApple’s announcement added to investors’ concerns about slowing global growth and reawakened the stock market’s bears. The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures tumbled more than 1 percent overnight.Shares of Apple dropped more than 9 percent in after-hours trading, a loss that was reflected in a wider range of companies. Chip makers like Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia, Skyworks and Qorvo were among the hardest hit, down more than 3 percent. The electronics retailer Best Buy slipped 2 percent, and companies with big business in China such as Boeing and Caterpillar fell 2 percent.Markets across Asia fell today, as investors shed technology stocks. European markets opened lower as well.Tesla has a record quarter, but price cuts prompt a sell-offApple wasn’t the only company to spook investors yesterday, as Tesla broke records in its fourth quarter but failed to impress the market.Good numbers, but not good enough: The automaker said it delivered 90,700 vehicles in the period, surpassing its earlier high. Of those, 63,150 were Model 3 sedans, a 13 percent improvement on the prior three-month span, but nonetheless below Wall Street’s expectations. The growth rate for the Model 3, Tesla’s first mass-market offering, fell short compared with the third quarter, when sales more than doubled amid a rush of initial orders.Demand concerns: Investors were especially perturbed by Tesla’s announcement that it was cutting prices of all models in the U.S. by $2,000 per car. The automaker said it was adjusting to a Jan. 1 reduction of a federal electric-vehicle tax credit for Tesla buyers to $3,750 from $7,500. But what the market saw was a warning that, after a surge of early interest in the Model 3, buyers may be waiting for a more affordable option, writes Bloomberg Opinion’s Liam Denning:“This suggests that the vast majority of reservation holders are either waiting overseas, where Tesla says deliveries should start next month, or (and this is probably the bigger group) are waiting for cheaper variants such as the long-promised $35,000 version. That latter group poses a potential threat to Tesla’s profit margins in the quarters ahead, especially as Model 3 production remains below previous targets.”Tesla shares ended trading nearly 7 percent lower.Censorship in China becomes a growing businessThousands of low-wage workers in China are trawling the internet in search of forbidden content in a lucrative new industry: censorship factories.Playing it safe: For Chinese companies, staying on the safe side of government censors is a matter of life and death. Adding to the burden, the authorities demand that companies censor themselves, spurring them to hire thousands of people to police content. “It helps cleanse the online environment,” one worker said.Little tolerance: China has built the world’s most extensive and sophisticated online censorship system. It grew even stronger under President Xi Jinping, who wants the internet to play a greater role in strengthening the Communist Party’s hold on society. More content is considered sensitive. Punishments are getting more severe.Rising influence: China’s vision of a government-supervised internet reverberates in other countries. Even in Western Europe and the United States, traditional bastions of free expression, companies are examining their digital limits. Platforms like Facebook and YouTube have said that they would hire thousands more workers to better monitor their content.China’s ‘new chapter’ in lunar explorationChina may have missed the starting gun in the international space race, but said today that it was the first to land a lunar probe on the far side of the moon.The Chang’e-4 vehicle, named after the lunar goddess in Chinese mythology, landed in the moon’s oldest and deepest crater and sent back the first close-up images of a region that perpetually faces away from earth.The China National Space Administration, which hopes to put astronauts in a lunar base by the end of the next decade, called the feat “a new chapter in humanity’s exploration of the moon.” The mission could help advance understanding of the moon’s origins and evolution, and better position China to tap minerals and other resources discovered there.China landed a rover on the moon in 2013, decades after a Soviet Union spacecraft reached the surface in 1959 and the United States successfully sent its Apollo 11 team in 1969. China’s future plans in space involve sending astronauts to Mars and a probe to Jupiter, according to the WSJ.The evolution of human welfare“The world got better last year, and it is going to get even better this year,” Greg Ip writes in the WSJ. Problems like illiteracy, poverty and violent deaths have been dropping worldwide, Ip writes, but the news has received little attention because the decline has been slow and steady.The gradual progress is coming about through basic rules of growth:“Invest more in your human and physical capital, open yourself to markets and trade — that’s right, globalization is good — and incomes will rise.”This has lead to momentous change: Half the world is now middle class.Revolving doorHalliburton named Jeff Miller its chairman after David Lesar retired on Monday following a 25-year career with the company.

We’ll see you tomorrow.We’d love your feedback. Please email thoughts and suggestions to business@nytimes.com.SAN FRANCISCO — Slack, a workplace messaging company, said Monday that it had confidentially filed paperwork for an initial public offering, joining the growing number of technology start-ups heading to the stock market.Slack, which is based in San Francisco, gave no details about the offering’s timing and said it was awaiting a standard review of its paperwork by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The move was expected given that Slack’s chief executive, Stewart Butterfield, had long indicated that he planned to take the company public. Slack recently hired Goldman Sachs to lead the offering.Slack’s confidential filing comes amid a rush by privately held companies to go public this year. Many of these start-ups, which have been highly valued by private investors, are part of a generation of technology companies known as unicorns. Public share sales by the companies are expected to create a bonanza of riches in Silicon Valley for entrepreneurs and venture capital investors.In December, the ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft filed confidential paperwork for their own public offerings. Their efforts stalled temporarily last month when a government shutdown hampered the S.E.C.’s ability to review the companies’ registration documents. Other tech companies expected to go public this year include the online scrapbooking firm Pinterest.Slack declined to comment beyond its statement about the confidential filing.There is likely to be a strong demand for Slack stock. The company was valued at $7.1 billion by private investors last year, but in recent weeks investment firms have offered to buy its shares at a price that values Slack at $13 billion, according to a person with knowledge of the details who was not authorized to speak publicly.Slack also plans an unusual form of public offering called a direct listing, the person added. Unlike most I.P.O.s, in which firms sell stock to public market investors in advance, direct listings let a company begin trading its shares on an exchange without raising new funds. Spotify, a provider of streaming music, went public in 2018 in a direct listing, paving the way for other high-profile start-ups to follow.With a direct listing, shareholders can also sell their stock immediately after the public offering, instead of waiting for what is known as a lockup period to expire.Slack has little need for cash. It raised $427 million in new financing in August, a year after raising $250 million. The company has collected a total of more than $1 billion from investors that include the SoftBank Vision Fund, General Atlantic, Dragoneer Investment Group and T. Rowe Price Associates.Mr. Butterfield began Slack out of a gaming start-up, Tiny Speck. While the company’s game products failed to take off, its internal communication tool showed promise. In 2014, the company began selling that communication tool, called Slack.Start-ups quickly adopted Slack, and larger companies followed suit. The company offers free and paid versions of Slack and counts more than 85,000 paying customers, including 65 Fortune 100 companies. Last month, Slack said 10 million people now used its product every day. The company generated more than $350 million in revenue last year, said the person with knowledge of the details.Some companies that have filed to go public have never reached that finish line. Over the last year, a number of high-profile business software companies that took steps to go public were snapped up by a tech giant at the last minute. In November, for example, Qualtrics, an analytics start-up, sold to SAP for $8 billion just days before it was set to ring the opening bell at Nasdaq.Google, Microsoft and Amazon have previously expressed interest in acquiring Slack, but the company has demurred. Now some of them have increasingly begun to compete with the start-up. When Microsoft introduced its own workplace messaging company, Microsoft Teams, in 2016, Slack took out a newspaper ad directed at its new competitor.“We’re genuinely excited to have some competition,” it read.In January, Microsoft announced that 420,000 organizations used its Teams product, including 89 of the Fortune 100.After rising for nine years in a so-so economy in the belief that prosperity was just around the corner, stocks swooned, even as growth picked up.That left many investors wondering whether the economy is turning another corner into a place where danger, maybe even a recession and a prolonged bear market, lurk.The S&P 500 dropped 13.5 percent during the fourth quarter, including dividends, giving the index a 4.4 percent loss for the year by that measure. It was the worst performance since 2008, despite strong corporate earnings and the best readings in several decades in unemployment and consumer confidence.As 2019 unfolds and the economic picture becomes clearer, it is possible that stocks will have a sustained, orderly recovery, investment advisers say. But achieving that clarity will take time, so they encourage investors to demand a lot of evidence that a recession will be avoided before they commit money to stocks or other risky assets.“A lot of the derating that happened in the second half of 2018 started off being driven by political risk, but in the last few weeks, it has been driven by concerns about growth and stability,” said Kate Moore, chief equity strategist at BlackRock, referring to the decline in stocks. “I think that’s going to go on in the first few weeks of 2019. Everyone’s focused on economic data.”Ms. Moore highlighted surveys showing weaker-than-expected business conditions and added: “It’s going to take time for that to work itself through the market. I would expect more volatility as we take in new data points.”Just how weak those data points are likely to be is hard to predict.“The underlying fundamentals of the economy certainly have deteriorated,” said Edward Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. He noted that the five monthly regional business surveys conducted by Federal Reserve districts “were all extremely weak in December.”But the latest employment report was not. It showed 312,000 net jobs created last month.“We have a very mixed economic picture right now,” Mr. Yardeni said. “It all adds up to an economy that’s slowing but probably still growing.” If that’s true, then 2019 may not be so bad for the market.“Stocks are very cheap, with one important qualification,” he said: “You have to believe the economy is not going to wind up in recession.”He then offered another qualification, about forthcoming corporate earnings reports: “We still have to curb our enthusiasm because we can’t get too excited about the earnings outlook.”The tax cuts that took effect in 2018 sent earnings up so much for the year — the latest estimate for the S&P 500 was 20.2 percent, according to FactSet Research — that a 5 percent rise in earnings in 2019, aided by corporate buybacks, is about as much as Wall Street can expect, Mr. Yardeni said. FactSet’s latest forecast is for a 7.3 percent increase.Despite some good days for the market in January that may have been prompted by signs of flexibility from the Federal Reserve, the way stocks tumbled late in the year hardly inspires confidence. With anything like a repeat performance, investors will have to hope that other assets provide better protection than in 2018, when there were few places to hide.“Cash was the only major asset class that posted positive returns in ’18,” according to a Bank of America report. Even the reed-thin 1.9 percent return on cash in money market funds was less than the 2.2 percent consumer inflation rate, the report said, but at least it was a positive number. Long-term government bonds, corporate bonds and gold all lost ground, although they beat the return of the S&P 500. Oil and foreign stocks were among the investments that did worse.The average domestic stock fund lost 14.2 percent in the fourth quarter, with specialists in natural resources, technology and financial services leading the way down. These funds dropped 6.8 percent during the year, according to Morningstar. International stock funds outperformed during the quarter, losing 10.9 percent, but trailed badly for the full year, down 13.2 percent.Bond funds lost 0.9 percent in the quarter and 1 percent for all of 2018. High-yield portfolios were particularly weak, off 4.6 percent for the quarter and 2.8 percent for the year.Such across-the-board weakness is rare “because what tends to be bad for one asset tends to be good for some other asset somewhere,” said Ben Inker, head of asset allocation for the investment firm GMO. “The basic exception is when there is a combination of rising rates and slowing growth. Risky assets don’t like slowing growth, and fixed income doesn’t like rising rates.”Mr. Inker, like many, is worried that the Fed could push a fragile economy into recession. That would be “fairly ugly for valuations” of American stocks, he said, and he would avoid them even if he were confident that a recession could be skirted. He prefers stocks and bonds in emerging markets, which are much cheaper than their counterparts in mature economies.“We’re reasonably bullish on our ability to make money in 2019, just not in the assets most people have most of their money in,” he said.One reason for the poor returns on stocks, especially in December, is that the Fed initially had not seemed to share the fear felt on Wall Street. When the Fed raised its target for short-term interest rates last month, the move was almost universally anticipated, but the statement about economic conditions and monetary policy made after the increase “was not as dovish as the market was hoping for,” said Steve Kane, a bond fund manager at TCW.Recent data “signals an economic slowdown,” and not just in the United States, Mr. Kane said. Surveys “confirm a significant drop in manufacturing activity. There are also signals that growth in China is slowing dramatically and significantly,” he said.The flattening yield curve, with short-term interest rates approaching long-term rates, is consistent with an economy that is running out of steam, and a source of concern in itself. But recent remarks by Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, that the central bank will have “patience” in deciding whether to raise rates, appeared to cheer the markets.If rates are priced for a slowdown, some corporate bonds are not, Mr. Kane said. At least not yet. Spreads in yields between corporate and government debt have widened, taking bond prices down. Medium-term investment-grade corporate issues yielded 1.76 percentage points more than equivalent Treasury paper, as of Tuesday, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and an index of high-yield debt yielded 4.65 points more. A two-point cushion is roughly where investment-grade spreads tend to peak during a slowdown, but high-yield spreads typically soar to 10 points.“One should look at the fixed-income market as being more attractive to invest in 2019 than 2018, but one must still invest with some degree of caution, especially in the high-yield market,” he said. “There will be better opportunities later in the year” in high yield, while “there is not too much downside to investment-grade credit at this point.” He called it “a fairly good asset class if we’re in the midst of a bear market in equities.”Stocks that Ms. Moore at BlackRock thinks would do comparatively well against such a backdrop are of companies that are financially strong and able to grow, even when economic growth is modest at best. Health care is her top sector because it has those defensive qualities, as well as pockets of innovation, such as in medical technology, that support high profit margins.She said she is “not throwing in the towel on tech” in general, despite plunging share prices in big names like Apple and Facebook, and she said she particularly likes Asian tech companies. Ms. Moore also is “modestly encouraged” about emerging markets in Latin America and Asia, most notably Brazil and India.Brian Singer, head of dynamic allocation strategies at William Blair & Company, has been investing “with a greater emphasis on risk management,” he said. He finds American stocks “fundamentally less attractive” than others, such as emerging markets, including the two that Ms. Moore mentioned.Among mature economies, Mr. Singer likes Britain, although he would rather wait until the question of its departure from the European Union, Brexit, is settled before stepping in, and Spain. Markets he is shunning, aside from the United States, are Japan, Canada, Mexico and South Africa. As for bonds, he is avoiding the high-yield market, and he talked up the virtues of another asset class that is often overlooked.“In this environment, cash will be a relatively good alternative,” he said. “It won’t be a great return generator, but being cautious and holding cash is not a bad idea. It really is a time to remain defensive and have dry powder on hand.”With so much up in the air, Mr. Yardeni recommends not getting carried away. Investors should be selective about stocks and avoid index-tracking exchange-traded funds.“This is probably a year for stock pickers,” he said. “It’s not a year for E.T.F.s.”He would emphasize domestic stocks and limit exposure to emerging markets, which may suffer from soft commodity prices, and to Europe, which is dealing with thorny issues like Brexit and Italy’s recalcitrance in reining in government spending. The aging population bodes ill for long-term growth in Europe, too, Mr. Yardeni said, something that also applies in China.He favors industries like technology, communications and media, which he expects to benefit over the long haul from the impending introduction of 5G, the fifth generation of mobile communications technology. Big banks and health care companies should do well, too, he said.With investors focused on what’s going wrong, Mr. Kane recommends that they also keep in mind what’s going right, in particular the strong job market, although he noted that employment is often the last indicator to deteriorate as the economic cycle turns.“If that part of the economy holds up, then this may not be a recession,” he said. “You could get a very nice return for stocks if that turns out to be the environment.” But he acknowledged that it’s a big if.A crucial question for him is whether the decline will be fairly mild by the time it’s over, or something more severe, as in the 2008 financial crisis. For all the talk of recession, the losses so far have appeared calm and orderly, suggesting to him that too few investors have been asking the same question.“Whether it’s a garden-variety or end-of-days bear market,” he said, “there’s going to be panic, and we haven’t gotten quite there yet.”On most afternoons, people arrive from across New York City with backpacks and plastic bags filled with boxes of small plastic strips, forming a line on the sidewalk outside a Harlem storefront.Hanging from the awning, a banner reads: “Get cash with your extra diabetic test strips.”Each strip is a laminate of plastic and chemicals little bigger than a fingernail, a single-use diagnostic test for measuring blood sugar. More than 30 million Americans have Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, and most use several test strips daily to monitor their condition.But at this store on W. 116th Street, each strip is also a lucrative commodity, part of an informal economy in unused strips nationwide. Often the sellers are insured and paid little out of pocket for the strips; the buyers may be underinsured or uninsured, and unable to pay retail prices, which can run well over $100 for a box of 100 strips.Some clinicians are surprised to learn of this vast resale market, but it has existed for decades, an unusual example of the vagaries of American health care. Unlike the resale of prescription drugs, which is prohibited by law, it is generally legal to resell unused test strips. And this store is far from the only place buying. Mobile phones light up with robo-texts: “We buy diabetic test strips!” Online, scores of companies thrive with names like TestStripSearch.com and QuickCash4TestStrips.com.“I’m taking advantage, as are my peers, of a loophole,” said the owner of one popular site, who asked that his name not be used. “We’re allowed to do that. I don’t even think we should be, frankly.”Test strips were first developed in 1965 to provide an immediate reading of blood sugar, or glucose, levels. The user pricks a finger, places a drop of blood on the strip, and inserts it into a meter that provides a reading.The test strips were created for use in doctors’ offices, but by 1980 medical-device manufacturers had designed meters for home use. They became the standard of care for many people with diabetes, who test their blood as often as ten times a day.Test strips are a multi-billion-dollar industry. A 2012 study found that among insulin-dependent patients who monitor their blood sugar, strips accounted for nearly one-quarter of pharmacy costs. Today, four manufacturers account for half of global sales.In a retail pharmacy, name-brand strips command high prices. But like most goods and services in American health care, that number doesn’t reflect what most people pay.The sticker price is the result of behind-the-scenes negotiations between the strips’ manufacturer and insurers. Manufacturers set a high list price and then negotiate to become an insurer’s preferred supplier by offering a hefty rebate. These transactions are invisible to the insured consumer, who might cover a copay, at most. But the arrangement leaves the uninsured — those least able to pay — paying sky-high sticker prices out of pocket. Also left out are the underinsured, who may need to first satisfy a high deductible. For a patient testing their blood many times a day, paying for strips out-of-pocket could add up to thousands of dollars a year. Small wonder, then, that a gray market thrives. The middlemen buy extras from people who obtained strips through insurance, at little cost to themselves, and then resell to the less fortunate.That was the opportunity that caught Chad Langley’s eye. He and his twin brother launched the website Teststripz.com to solicit test strips from the public for resale. Today they buy strips from roughly 8,000 people; their third-floor office in Reading, Mass., receives around 100 deliveries a day.The amount the Langleys pay depends on the brand, expiration date and condition, but the profit margins are reliably high. For example, the brothers will pay $35 plus shipping for a 100-count box of the popular brand Freestyle Lite in mint condition.The Langleys sell the box for $60. CVS, by contrast, retails the strips for $164.The Langleys are mainly buying up excess strips from insured patients who have been flooded with them, sometimes even when not medically necessary. Although patients who manage their diabetes with non-insulin medications or with diet and exercise needn’t test their blood sugar daily, a recent analysis of insurance claims found that nearly one in seven patients still used test strips regularly.‘It’s a tiny little piece of plastic that’s super cheap to manufacture, and they’ve managed to make a cash cow out of it.’Gretchen ObristThe market glut is also a consequence of a strategy adopted by manufacturers to sell patients proprietary meters designed to read only their brand of strips. If a patient’s insurer shifts her to a new brand, she must get a new meter, often leaving behind a supply of useless strips.While some resellers use websites like Amazon or eBay to market strips directly to consumers, the biggest profits are in returning them to retail pharmacies, which sell them as new and bill the customer’s insurance the full price.The insurer reimburses the pharmacy the retail price and then demands a partial rebate from the manufacturer — but it’s a rebate the manufacturer has paid already for this box of strips.Glenn Johnson, general manager for market access at Abbott Diabetes Care, which makes about one in five strips purchased in the United States, said manufacturers lose more than $100 million in profits a year this way, much of it in New York, California and Florida.The company supported a new California law that prohibits pharmacies from acquiring test strips from any but an authorized list of distributors. Mr. Johnson said he has spoken with lawmakers about similar efforts in Florida, New Jersey, New York and Ohio.Such measures leave intact the inflated retail prices that make the gray market possible and which critics say benefit manufacturers and their retail intermediaries, pharmacy benefit managers.In a lawsuit against P.B.M.’s and the dominant test strip manufacturers filed in New Jersey, consumer advocates presented data showing that the average wholesale price for test strips has risen as much as 70 percent over the last decade.They alleged that this has allowed the defendants to pocket an unfair portion of the rebates. The price of a strip would be much lower if it wasn’t fattened by profiteering, said Gretchen Obrist, one of the lawyers who brought the case.“It’s a tiny little piece of plastic that’s super cheap to manufacture, and they’ve managed to make a cash cow out of it,” she said.To justify the rising price of strips, manufacturers point to advances in engineering that have made the strips smaller and more convenient to use. But there is little evidence those features have improved health outcomes for people with diabetes — and with increasingly unaffordable prices, the newfangled test strips may be even less accessible.The markups on strips look particularly stark when compared to the cost of producing them.“Test strips are basically printed, like in a printing press,” said David Kliff, who publishes a newsletter on diabetes. “It’s not brain surgery.”He estimated the typical test strip costs less than a dime to make. The median rents for one-bedroom apartments in the 10 most populous metropolitan markets in the United States were relatively unchanged from December 2018 to January 2019. But over the past year, the differences were more dramatic.Zumper.com’s monthly rent report, which also tracks year-over-year changes, examined a million active listings in the 100 most populated metropolitan areas in the country and found that renters in New York had reason to rejoice, at least a little.Of the 10 most expensive housing markets, New York City was one of only two where rents went down. In the last year, the median one-bedroom rent in the city decreased by about 3 percent, to $2,780.Renters in Washington, D.C., can also celebrate, as the median one-bedroom rent dropped by about 7 percent, to $2,130.In the rest of the 10 costliest markets, median rents were up. But if you live in one of the other 90 major metropolitan areas in the United States, you’re in luck: Overall, median one-bedroom rents were down, by about 2.5 percent.For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

The market sure hopes soA report from the WSJ on Thursday said that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had suggested ending some or all tariffs against China, lifting global stocks even after his agency stressed that trade talks were far from complete.Mr. Mnuchin said that easing the penalties would encourage China to make longer-term concessions while calming jittery markets, according to the report, which cited anonymous sources.The Treasury Department later said that officials had made no recommendations on tariffs.China’s trade czar, Liu He, is scheduled to participate in negotiations in Washington on Jan. 30. After March 1, tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to grow to 25 percent from 10 percent.In other China news:• China’s ambassador to Canada warned of “repercussions” if the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei were blocked from Canada’s 5G network. Huawei’s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, was arrested last month in Vancouver, British Columbia, and the company has also faced resistance and suspicion from Germany, the U.S. and other Western countries.• Foreign investors such as Blackstone Group spent a record $9 billion on commercial real estate in China last year.• Chinese tech companies, stressed by trade tensions, stricter policing of online content and a slowing domestic economy, cut hiring ads 20 percent in the last quarter of 2018.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________Paramount, lurching toward irrelevancy, hopes for a turnaroundAfter decades of mismanagement, Paramount Pictures, the once-vaunted studio behind classic films like “The Godfather” and “Chinatown,” is fighting for its existence, write Amy Chozick and Brooks Barnes.The challenge: The studio racked up nearly $900 million in losses in the last two years. It has placed last at the domestic box office for seven years running. It shed its lucrative TV business years ago. And the Paramount lot is long overdue for improvements.The competition: The old-line film business is going to become tougher as streaming services proliferate. Netflix will pump out about 90 movies this year. Apple intends to roll out its multibillion-dollar TV and movie offering, and Facebook has become serious about its Watch video-on-demand platform.The solution: Paramount restarted television production in 2013 and now has nine series running, including “Jack Ryan” on Amazon Prime. It hired one of Hollywood’s top producers, Wyck Godfrey, as president of the film division. And it hopes to make 17 movies in 2020, with a focus on big budgets and global audiences.Playground brawls on Capitol HillOn the 28th day of the government shutdown, Washington feels like “an unruly sandbox,” where “septuagenarian politicians are squabbling like 7-year-olds,” writes Mark Landler.Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who had pressed President Trump to postpone his State of the Union address, received his sarcasm-laced response on Thursday.Without mentioning the speech, the president said he was canceling a secret trip for Ms. Pelosi and other members of Congress to meet with NATO officials in Brussels and visit American troops in Afghanistan. She was expected to depart Thursday on a military aircraft; Mr. Trump said she could fly commercial, “obviously.”Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, was not amused. He said in a statement:“One sophomoric response does not deserve another.”President Trump also canceled a U.S. delegation set to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. But Melania Trump, the first lady, kept her plans to fly on a military jet to the family’s Mar-a-Lago compound in Florida.The stalemate over Homeland Security spending has grown increasingly bitter.

But a filing could be wrenching for power producers, especially those in renewable resources, write Ivan Penn and Peter Eavis.PG&E said that it would use bankruptcy protection to resolve huge liabilities arising from deadly wildfires in California. Such a move would allow it to walk away from older contracts with suppliers, particularly those with developers of renewable energy that were negotiated when solar panel prices were higher.Credit Suisse analysts estimate that PG&E could save $2.2 billion a year by renegotiating renewable power contracts down to current market prices.More news: The prospective bankruptcy has exposed the risks of green-power investments: If the utility can renegotiate high-cost contracts, other companies will do the same. Fitch Ratings said the planned bankruptcy would not damage California’s credit rating.Rihanna: pop star, actress, entrepreneur … luxury fashion brand?She was named fashion icon of the year by the Council of Fashion Designers of America in 2014. She became Dior’s first black brand ambassador in 2015. Her Fenty Beauty cosmetics line is intensely popular; her Fenty x Savage lingerie collection debuted to great acclaim at New York Fashion Week.It looks like LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the parent company of Dior, Givenchy and Fendi, could do worse than partnering with Robyn Rihanna Fenty.The luxury conglomerate is working on a deal that would make Rihanna its first female designer of color. The partnership would build a brand from scratch in a way the company hasn’t tried since starting the Christian Lacroix label in 1987, according to anonymous sources.The deal would be “a turning point in both fashion and fame,” writes Vanessa Friedman, who calls it:“The clearest expression yet of how celebrity, social media and influencers have redefined the power balance between culture and consumption, changing the way brands of all kinds relate to their audience.”Wall Street is nervous about luxury spending, however, as stock market declines in recent months could compel consumers to scale back purchases, according to an analysis from Goldman Sachs.Revolving doorNews Corporation said that Jesse Angelo was stepping down as publisher and chief executive at The New York Post.

Please email thoughts and suggestions to bizday@nytimes.com.BANGKOK — Next to a row of luxury hotels in a bustling business district here in Bangkok, the art gallery Nova Contemporary occupies a former storage area at the base of a high-rise apartment building.“There’s no gallery area per se in Bangkok, so this is fairly normal,” said Nova’s cheery owner, Sutima Sucharitakul, of the location of her sleek space. “Everything is fairly spread out.”On view at Nova through Sunday is a conceptual exhibition called “The Uncertain,” featuring works by the Thai artist Jedsada Tangtrakulwong.By design, the show changes depending on the weather: On sunny days, some of the works are not available to be seen, remaining hidden in various ways, and the response to that offbeat approach has been mixed. Some visitors have been angered and have shared their feelings emphatically with Ms. Sucharitakul and her staff.“This is pretty advanced for Bangkok,” she said with a shrug.Her hunt for an appreciative new audience for her artists is precisely why she will show her wares for the first time at Art Basel Hong Kong, alongside about 240 other dealers, from Friday through Sunday at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center.Nova reflects the stronger Southeast Asian presence at the fair, now in its seventh edition, demonstrating the event’s status as a market hub in a vast and diverse region.There is no shortage of collectors with money or artists with ideas; they simply need a place to find each other.“The presence of the Southeast Asian dealers is quite remarkable this year, and quite varied,” said Adeline Ooi, the Asia director for Art Basel.“It’s wonderful — but I’m biased since I’m from Malaysia,” she said, laughing.In addition to galleries from mainland China, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Japan — already known as market forces — the fair this year includes Richard Koh Fine Art, with spaces in Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore; Artinformal and Silverlens, both from Manila; and Nadi Gallery and ROH Projects from Jakarta, Indonesia.“People think the Asian market equals the Chinese market, and that’s not true,” Ms. Ooi said. “Asia is a puzzle. But every year at the fair, we peel back a new layer and it gets deeper.”Part of the issue is vast geography. The fair features six galleries that have exhibition spaces in India, which is more than 2,000 miles from Hong Kong.“Asia is so massive,” Ms. Ooi said. “People think we know each other, and we don’t. We’re all still learning about each other.”She added, “It’s one of the things that makes me hopeful — the show can be a platform for movements that don’t always catch the attention of the art world.”Marc Spiegler, the global director of Art Basel, said he was in awe of the “unparalleled diversity” on hand.“It’s been a voyage of discovery to do a fair in Asia and dig into the real complexity,” Mr. Spiegler said. “You have countries that are Buddhist or Christian or secular, colonizers and the colonized, and dozens of languages.”By contrast, Europe — where Art Basel started and where it stages a fair in Basel, Switzerland, in June — “is so small that cultures bleed together,” he added. (There’s also a Miami Beach fair in December.)Like Ms. Ooi, Mr. Spiegler said that he thought the contingents from Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and other neighboring countries were significant.“The Southeast Asian element is often underestimated by the market in terms of the collectors, galleries and the artists,” he said.That was certainly the opinion of Jun Tirtadji when he founded ROH Projects in Jakarta six years ago. “We felt there was a need in Indonesia,” Mr. Tirtadji said. “There’s so much talent here.”ROH has been participating in Art Basel Hong Kong for five years, and the fair has helped shape the business beyond just the few days of the event.“We have learned so much from Adeline and Marc,” Mr. Tirtadji said. “I attribute a lot of our success to them. They took it upon themselves to provide a guiding framework for how a gallery should be run.”ROH specializes in emerging Asian contemporary talents, and this year it features eight artists including Arin Dwihartanto Sunaryo, an abstract painter based in Bandung, Indonesia, who works with pigmented resin and ash, forming paintings with his hands instead of a brush.Mr. Tirtadji said that the scene in Jakarta, in all its contradictions, had to be viewed through a different lens from that of New York or Hong Kong.“The art world in Indonesia is quite cosmopolitan,” he said. He added, “But many of our collectors are buying their first piece of art with us.”Isa Lorenzo, the founder of Silverlens, has been showing at the fair since it was called Art HK, before it was bought by Art Basel’s parent company.“There’s definitely a north-south division,” she said of the Asian market. “The north is much bigger economically, but fewer items are bought and sold. In the south, it’s more chaotic, but a lot more is bought and sold, at lower price points.”At Silverlens, Ms. Lorenzo changes exhibitions regularly, “and every opening is packed,” she said. “It’s a vibrant arts scene and very community-oriented in the Philippines. We have zero government funding for the arts. We have to all hold hands and make it happen ourselves.”In the fair’s Kabinett sector, Silverlens will present the work of Pacita Abad (1946-2004), a Philippine artist who lived all over the world, including the United States. The booth will display pieces from her “Masks and Spirits” series.“She did a combination of quilting, painting and sewing objects onto canvas,” Ms. Lorenzo said. “It’s an alchemy that combines all these traditions.”Despite her presence in collections around the world, to Ms. Lorenzo’s mind the artists is “still somewhat under the radar, and needs to be represented everywhere as a major artist.”Hong Kong’s reputation has also been attracting Western galleries.Ms. Ooi said organizers were excited about the “heavyweights” taking part for the first time this year, including the New York dealers Paula Cooper and Matthew Marks.The dealer Almine Rech, who has galleries in Paris, London, Brussels and New York — and will soon open one in Shanghai — has had a booth at Art Basel Hong Kong since the first edition.“For us, the Asian market is ever more important — especially in the last two or three years,” Ms. Rech said.As a dealer accustomed to far-flung transactions, Ms. Rech said that the Asian market was still “a very different world.”“Collectors often want to have an adviser on hand, and they want to have a dialogue about an artwork right in front of a piece,” she said. “They take time, they have a long discussion and then they make a decision.”By contrast, Ms. Rech said, “Americans feel they know a lot already.”Her selection at the fair will include works by Picasso, Peter Halley and Tom Wesselmann.For her part, Ms. Sucharitakul’s Nova Contemporary booth will show sculptures and videos by the artist Moe Satt, who lives and works in Myanmar, in the fair’s Discoveries sector.The centerpiece of the booth is “Dove With Revolution Hand,” a sculpture by Mr. Satt that addresses the 1988 civil uprising in Myanmar.As Ms. Sucharitakul has learned, the reaction of collectors to a given work is anyone’s guess. But shortly before the fair, she was hopeful not only for sales, but also for the biggest Thai collectors back home to know that she was a part of Art Basel Hong Kong.“It will get me a lot of respect,” she said. “People know what this fair is, and that it means something.”Anyone paying attention to financial markets in recent months knew that the Federal Reserve’s management of the economy was perhaps the single most important question on the minds of investors.The Fed, of course, has been raising interest rates, including four increases last year, which unnerved many investors. These days, though, the focus has shifted to what the central bank will do with another tool it previously used to stoke economic growth.As part of its campaign to rescue the economy after the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed bought enormous quantities of bonds issued or guaranteed by the federal government. Now the question is how quickly, and by how much, it will shrink that pile. On Wednesday, the Fed left rates unchanged and signaled that it could slow its bond sales if economic and financial conditions change. Investors cheered, with the S&P 500 rising about 1.5 percent. The index is up nearly 7 percent this year.Once an area of interest for only the most intrepid of Fed watchers, the bond portfolio has started to overshadow more fundamental economic concerns, like China’s slowing economy and the government shutdown. Since last year, the Fed has been reducing its bond stockpile by up to $50 billion a month. Investors increasingly point to the trend to explain the ugly performances of virtually every kind of investment in 2018. Even President Trump weighed in, tweeting in December that the Fed should “Stop with the 50 B’s.”Players in the markets have bestowed the Fed’s bond-shedding policy with its very own nickname: quantitative tightening, or Q.T.So what is quantitative tightening? How is it supposed to work? And how much of an impact is it having on markets? Read on.Before there was Q.T., there was Q.E.The first thing to know is that quantitative tightening is basically the slow unwinding of a series of policies put in place to counter the financial crisis. A decade ago, that crisis nearly pushed the United States into a second Great Depression. Financial markets crashed. Unemployment surged. Economic growth collapsed. By law, the Fed is supposed to fight unemployment. So, when recession rears its head, the central bank steps in, typically by cutting the short-term interest rates it controls. By the end of 2008, it had slashed them essentially to zero. During normal times, short-term interest rates have a strong influence on how much it costs consumers and companies to borrow money. But during the financial crisis, the Fed’s rate cuts barely budged longer-term borrowing rates, which stayed stubbornly high. Investors were so spooked that they refused to put their money into anything other than super-safe, short-term government bonds. The Fed needed to push longer-term interest rates down. With short-term rates at their lowest possible levels, the central bank went looking for new tools. And that is how quantitative easing was born. In early 2009, the Fed started buying immense quantities of bonds — trying to drive their prices up and their rates down. By 2014, the Fed was the proud owner of roughly $2.5 trillion worth of Treasury bonds and more than $1.5 trillion of government-backed mortgage bonds. Did it work?Yes. The Fed’s bond-buying didn’t immediately cure every economic ill brought on by the recession. The United States would limp through nearly a decade of sluggish growth, even as the Fed continued to devour bonds. But the consensus among investors and policymakers is that all of the bond purchases helped push key borrowing rates — such as those for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages and for corporate bonds — to their lowest levels in a generation. That made loans at least a little more affordable and offered some support to the fragile economy. In the stock and bond markets, the power of the Fed’s campaign was even more pronounced. By pumping trillions of dollars into the financial system, quantitative easing propped up the value of stocks, bonds and all sorts of other assets. Few in the markets think it a coincidence that the beginning of Q.E. was also the beginning of the longest bull market in history.Now comes Q.T.A decade later, the economy is in much better shape. Unemployment is at its lowest level in decades. Early data indicates that the economy last year grew at its fastest clip since 2005. Wages are even starting to rise. To the central bank, those rosy economic signs meant it was time to start removing some of the scaffolding it had erected to support the crumbling economy. The Fed started raising interest rates in December 2015. And it has also started to shrink its hoard of bonds. Last year, the Fed’s portfolio declined by more than $350 billion — the sharpest reduction since the crisis. You may have also noticed that the financial markets were battered last year. Almost every type of investment seemed to suffer the same lackluster returns. The S&P 500 was down 6.2 percent. High-quality corporate bonds sank 6.4 percent. United States Treasury bonds generated a paltry 0.9 percent return. A collapse in crude oil prices sent commodities down more than 15 percent. In fact, it was the first time in decades that virtually all major classes of investments suffered in sync, with none posting returns in excess of 5 percent. The concern over Q.T. flared in December. As stock markets swung wildly, Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chairman, played down the chance that the central bank would change its approach to its steady bond reductions, which he described as being on “automatic pilot.” The stock market sank about 6 percent in the days after that statement. The Fed’s shrinking bond portfolio isn’t entirely to blame for the carnage of 2018. Plenty of other things had investors worrying: a slowdown in global growth, weakening corporate profits, the trade war with China and the Fed’s rate increases.Economists inside and outside the Fed say the impact last year should have been relatively small. After all, the gradual, recurring bond reductions were set in motion years ago, and should have been incorporated into prices in financial markets.Nevertheless, investors welcomed the Fed’s message on Wednesday that it could change its plans to reduce its bond holdings. The central bank said in a news release that it was “prepared to adjust any of the details for completing balance sheet normalization in light of economic and financial developments.” In a news conference, Mr. Powell also suggested that the decline of the Fed’s bond holdings could stop sooner and leave the Fed with a larger supply of bonds than previously thought. “Any conversation about the balance sheet that does not use the word autopilot is good,” said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute.

What’s happening?Big tech companies are reporting lackluster results. Weak Chinese consumer demand blew a $9 billion hole in Apple’s latest quarterly sales. Nvidia warned last month that its revenue would come in 20 percent below expectations. Intel’s January financials didn’t meet forecasts. And Samsung’s sales plunged 10 percent in the fourth quarter.Behind the trend: semiconductors. “China, smartphones, Bitcoin and cloud computing have been among the major drivers of the long tech boom, which in turn has powered the global economy for the last decade. The ingredient common to all of these sectors is computer chips, which form the brains of devices and whose ubiquity means they provide early signals about changes in supply and demand,” write David Streitfeld and Don Clark of the NYT. With chip manufacturers predicting slumping sales for 2019, tech more generally could be in line for a slowdown.Sound familiar? “The notion that a chip dip could lead to a general downturn evokes memories of 2000, when one day tech had an unlimited future and the next it was crashing in what became known as the dot-com bust,” write Mr. Streitfeld and Mr. Clark.And the industry no longer carries the stock market. For years, stock market performance have been tied to the fortunes of the largest tech companies: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Netflix. As the S&P 500 pushed to a record high last summer, rises in those six companies’ share prices accounted for half of its gain. But when the index rallied nearly 8 percent in January, Stephen Grocer writes, their stocks accounted for just 17 percent of the rise.Lloyd Blankfein may pay for Goldman’s links to 1MDBThe former Goldman Sachs C.E.O. — as well as his successor, David Solomon, and other top executives — may have to give back some compensation from 2018, depending on the findings of an investigation into the firm’s work with the scandal-ridden Malaysian investment fund 1MDB.The announcement, made in a regulatory filing on Friday, shows how seriously Goldman is treating any role it may have had in fraud committed at 1MDB. Prosecutors in the U.S. and Malaysia are leading criminal investigations into 1MDB, and a former top deal maker at the firm has pleaded guilty to bribery, conspiracy and money laundering charges. Goldman says it’s cooperating with authorities.The WSJ calculates that Mr. Blankfein, who stepped down as chief executive of Goldman last year, might lose millions. And though Mr. Solomon wasn’t a top-ranking Goldman executive at the time, he could see some of his $23 million pay for last year clawed back as well. (Gary Cohn, who was Goldman’s No. 2 during the 1MDB work and received a lump payout when he left the firm in 2017, wouldn’t be affected.)In lighter Goldman news: Mr. Solomon, whose side hustle is DJing as DJ D-Sol, has released his second single, “Feel Alive.”Deutsche Bank refused Trump a loan in 2016For two decades, Deutsche Bank was the only major lender to give Donald Trump money, helping him finance his real estate operations. But when he sought a loan in early 2016 to help pay for a Scottish golf course — all while running for president — the German lender said no.More from David Enrich, Jesse Drucker and Ben Protess of the NYT:Senior officials at the bank, including its future chief executive, believed that Mr. Trump’s divisive candidacy made such a loan too risky, the people said. Among their concerns was that if Mr. Trump won the election and then defaulted, Deutsche Bank would have to choose between not collecting on the debt or seizing the assets of the president of the United States.What’s next: Expect House Democrats to include this in their investigation of Mr. Trump’s finances.More Deutsche Bank news: The lender reportedly scrambled to rid itself of a $600 million loan made to VTB, a Russian state-owned bank, in late 2016 as the German bank sought to reduce its exposure to Russian entities.How an S.U.V. became a Brexit warning signThe automaker Nissan confirmed yesterday that it had abandoned plans to build its new X-Trail sport utility vehicle in Britain and said that the car would be produced solely in Japan. It’s a blow for the British economy, and a clear signal that uncertainty over Britain’s withdrawal from the E.U. is weighing on corporate minds.A clear culprit. “The continued uncertainty around the U.K.’s future relationship with the E.U. is not helping companies like ours to plan for the future,” Nissan’s Europe chairman, Gianluca de Ficchy, said in a statement. Greg Clark, Britain’s business secretary, told the FT that it was “a warning sign” about how much damage could be caused by a no-deal Brexit.Nissan is not alone. British C.F.O.s say that Brexit is currently the largest threat to their businesses. Some 78 percent of those surveyed said that the business environment in the nation would deteriorate if Britain left the E.U.What now? Prime Minister Theresa May is set to return to Brussels in the coming days in an attempt to redraft her Brexit deal. In the meantime, Bloomberg reports that she “will launch a new government working group intended to unite the feuding pro- and anti-Brexit factions” in her party.The oil field that made American oil greatThe U.S. is now the top oil producer in the world, able to sway petroleum prices and breezily sanction Iran and Venezuela. The reason, as Cliff Krauss of the NYT notes: the Permian Basin, the heart of America’s shale industry.How big is it? It covers the same area as South Dakota, and produces four million barrels of oil a day — making it a bigger generator of oil than any member of OPEC other than Iraq and Saudi Arabia.What makes it special? It’s huge and rich in oil rather than in less-valuable natural gas. And it’s close to refineries on the Gulf of Mexico.What could go wrong? Oil companies there might pump too much, drawing ire from OPEC. As Scott Sheffield, the chairman of Pioneer Natural Resources, told the NYT: “You could have another price war.” And U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan crude could hurt American refineries, which can’t rely solely on the Permian.Hungry for ‘executive time’ in your calendar? Study Trump’s schedule and weepAxios has published almost three months of President Trump’s schedules after they were leaked, reportedly by somebody in the White House. Some highlights:• “Trump has spent around 60 percent of his scheduled time over the past three months in unstructured ‘Executive Time.’ ”• “He spends his mornings in the residence, watching TV, reading the papers, and responding to what he sees and reads by phoning aides, members of Congress, friends, administration officials and informal advisers,” six people with direct knowledge of his schedule told Axios.• “Trump’s first meeting of the day — usually around 11 or 11:30 a.m. — is often an intelligence briefing or a 30-minute meeting with the chief of staff.”• “The president sometimes has meetings during Executive Time that he doesn’t want most West Wing staff to know about for fear of leaks. And his mornings sometimes include calls with heads of state, political meetings and meetings with counsel in the residence, which aren’t captured on these schedules.”Bonus: Axios also compared the schedules with those of Mr. Trump’s predecessors. He appears to share most in common with Bill Clinton’s early days in office.2019’s Super Bowl ads: nostalgia, wokeness and depressing techO.K., so the game itself may have been a slog to watch, and the halftime show was forgettable. But for those of you who came for the ads, here are the themes that dominated — to the tune of $5.2 million per 30 seconds of airtime.The ’90s: Stella Artois featured Carrie Bradshaw from “Sex and the City” and the Dude from “The Big Lebowski.” Doritos put the Backstreet Boys front and center.Social consciousness: The dating app Bumble hired Serena Williams to urge women to “make the first move” in all parts of their lives. And Budweiser touted renewable energy in an ad featuring a cute dog.The downsides of tech: Olay’s spot showed the actress Sarah Michelle Gellar struggling to save herself from a home intruder when her phone’s facial-recognition software fails. An ad for Pringles featured a smart speaker bemoaning its existence. And TurboTax built an ad around a robot boy craving a late-night snack.Revolving doorApple reportedly removed Bill Stasior as the head of its Siri virtual assistant unit, though he remains at the company.Gianni Infantino is poised to win a second term as president of FIFA, soccer’s global governing body.SoftBank of Japan hired Sarah Lubman, most recently a partner at the Brunswick Group, as a partner in corporate communications.The speed readDeals• Spotify is said to be in talks to buy the podcasting company Gimlet Media.

He urged broad diversification into such vehicles as Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, commodities and real estate investment trusts, as well as a tax-sheltered structure known as a master limited partnership. But he concedes that with “the exception of M.L.P.s,” all are expensively priced.Holding cash, in the form of a money-market fund, is another answer, but it is far from perfect, he said. “The problem with cash is you don’t make any money,” Mr. Brightman said. “It’s the safest place to keep your money, but you get zero real return.”Nick Kalivas, senior equity product strategist at Invesco, said it was worth at least “thinking about” tweaking a portfolio to fortify it against risk.He suggests funds that focus on stocks specifically selected because their fluctuations are low: They are known as low-volatility stocks, and they have outperformed the S&P 500 in 14 of the last 15 market downturns since 2011, according to Invesco.Four times a year, Invesco compiles a list of the lowest-volatility stocks in the S&P 500. These are the companies whose shares are least affected by market turbulence. The current list features Coca-Cola as the least-volatile equity, followed by two utilities, the WEC Energy Group and Duke Energy, according to Mr. Kalivas.Low-volatility stocks outperformed the market for most of 2018, according to Mo Haghbin, head of product research and development for Oppenheimer funds. Through December, portfolios of low-volatility stocks in the Oppenheimer Russell 1000 Dynamic Multifactor Exchange-Traded Fund lost 2.43 percent as opposed to the fund’s benchmark, the Russell 1000, which lost 4.78 percent, Mr. Haghbin said. High-quality companies — defined by superior grades on such metrics as return on assets, profits, margins and leverage — also outperformed, losing 2.68 percent.But investors who shift toward low-volatility portfolios should remember that such portfolios have historically lagged once the market turns up.Two low-volatility E.T.F.s that outperformed the S&P 500 in 2018 were: Hartford Multifactor Low Volatility US Equity E.T.F., which was basically flat, and Invesco S&P 500 Low Volatility E.T.F., which lost just over 2 percent. The S&P 500 was down 6.2 percent last year.Investors may also be wondering what to do about tech stocks, especially the Faangs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google), which have been losing altitude rapidly after a seemingly endless ascent.Through December, Facebook and Netflix were both down over 35 percent from their highs of last year. Apple and Amazon were each off more than 25 percent from their 2018 highs.Although Kevin Landis is portfolio manager of the tech-focused Firsthand Technology Opportunities fund, he said he is wary of the big tech stocks. “When companies get bigger, they start looking more and more like government agencies,” he said. “Even the biggest opportunities are at the saturation point. There’s only so many iPhones you can sell.”With evidence of rising public concern about consumer privacy, Mr. Landis said, he expects to see greater regulation. “I spent the last 15 to 20 years being appalled at how readily people surrendered their own privacy,” he said. “I welcome the idea that they’ve become more aware.”Mr. Landis said there were still good values in smaller tech companies. One major holding is Roku, which hopes to lure consumers who subscribe to cable. He contrasted its market cap of under $4 billion with Netflix’s $111 billion market cap and said Roku was a better value.But many advisers say investors should simply hold tight. Brian McMahon, manager of the Thornburg Investment Income Builder mutual fund, said that in many ways, the recent downturn “is pretty normal. This is not something to panic about.” He said his largest investment, the CME Group, benefits from an active market. It makes good profits when people trade on options and futures contracts made on its platforms, he said. “CME Group benefits from volatility,” he said.In a similar vein, Kate Moore, chief equity strategist at BlackRock, said, “This is not a time to derisk and become completely defensive.” There are still “pockets of quality” in the volatile markets, she added, citing the Chinese tech sector as one example.But she said there were at least two major threats in the longer term. “We are increasingly concerned about long-term deficits and their impact on the bond market,” she said. Bonds, already pressured in the near term by Federal Reserve rate increases, could also face long-term rate pressure from the ballooning Treasury financing required by mounting budget deficits.Ms. Moore also said tech stocks could eventually lose value if new regulations were imposed to protect consumer privacy. “We don’t expect any major regulatory changes in 2019,” she said. “We certainly expect the government will impose regulations over the medium term.”Mr. Haghbin of Oppenheimer emphasized that portfolio decisions should reflect an investor’s view of the larger economy. “If an investor feels that growth will continue to slow and risk appetite continue to decline, historically he would emphasize high-quality and low-volatility companies.”But, as Mr. Haghbin warned, investors may need to be nimble. “Things can change very quickly,” he said.The Bull Market Began 10 Years Ago. Why Aren’t More People Celebrating?Americans are still scarred by the financial crisis, and the fruits of this decade’s record-breaking rally fell mostly to the rich.By Matt PhillipsMarch 9, 2019The financial system had nearly collapsed. The deepest recession in decades was devouring over 700,000 jobs a month. Roughly $13 trillion in stock market wealth, slowly rebuilt since the dot-com bust, had again been incinerated. It was March 2009. And it was one of the best times in a generation to buy stocks.A decade later, the bull market that began back then ranks among the great rallies in stock-market history. The 305 percent surge in the S&P 500 is the index’s second-best run ever.The rise has generated more than $30 trillion in wealth. Adjusted for inflation, that is the most created during any bull run on record, edging out the $25 trillion in gains during the epic streak from December 1987 to March 2000, which ended with the bursting of the dot-com bubble, according to Federal Reserve data.But compared with Americans’ attitudes during that earlier climb, reactions to the latest rally are downright subdued. There has been no frenzy for stock trading. Nobody is quitting an accounting, advertising, or waitressing job to concentrate on day trading.Why so somber? The psychological and financial damage inflicted by the 2008 financial crisis and the ensuing Great Recession continue to weigh heavily. Fewer people are invested in stocks than before that meltdown, and many of them are wary of taking their gains for granted. That caution could last for decades.“This was probably the most disliked or most suspected rally that we’ve ever had in the stock market,” said Charles Geisst, a professor at Manhattan College who has studied the history of financial markets. Birth of the BullOn March 9, 2009, the day the bull market was born, the stock market, like the economy, was in deep, seemingly existential distress. The S&P 500 was down 57 percent from its 2007 peak. Compounding the pain was the nationwide collapse in home prices, which landed a direct hit on most households’ greatest source of wealth. The one-two punch destroyed the finances of millions of families. Between 2007 and 2010, the median wealth of a household in the United States dropped 44 percent, knocked below 1969 levels.Every crash has a bottom, though, and in March 2009, the Federal Reserve announced that it would spend $1 trillion in newly created dollars on government and mortgage bonds to push interest rates lower. It was the dawn of “quantitative easing” — and, it would turn out, a new bull market. The S&P 500 rose 8.5 percent that month, its best monthly performance in more than six years.“That should have been the signal to everyone that you can go out there and buy stocks with impunity,” said Byron Wien, vice chairman of the private wealth group at Blackstone, the private equity firm.But to buy stocks, you need money. After watching their fortunes — and retirement funds — shrivel, few Americans were in a position to take a fresh flier on beaten-down stocks.Those who could were already well-off. In 2007, the wealthiest 10 percent of American families owned 81 percent of the nation’s household stock market wealth, according Ed Wolff, a professor of economics at New York University who studies the distribution of wealth in the United States. By 2016, they owned 84 percent, he said.The recovery in the stock market made those families even richer, increasing their net worth by double-digit percentages. Median American family wealth, meanwhile, dropped 34 percent.In the past, such episodes of wealth destruction cast long shadows. For much of the 20th century, the financial habits of the American public were heavily influenced by memories of the Great Depression.Even in the 1960s, survey data showed that people who were young during the Great Depression were much less likely to invest in stocks, according to research by two economists, Ulrike Malmendier of the University of California, Berkeley, and Stefan Nagel of the University of Chicago. The 2008 crisis was nowhere near as severe, but a similar dynamic may be affecting people who started their working lives around that time.Gallup survey data shows that in the last decade, an average of 38 percent of Americans under the age of 35 have money invested in the stock market. That compares with 52 percent before the crisis. Playing It SafeEven those who are invested are behaving differently, both in how they invest and what they’re doing with the proceeds. In the decade since the bull market began, the share of Americans investing via index funds, which aim to mimic the performance of benchmarks like the S&P 500, has increased significantly. In 2017, 43 percent of all the money in American stock market funds was in index funds. Back in 2007, only 19 percent of stock market assets were in these passive strategies, a style of investing that acknowledges that, for most people, trying to beat the market through savvy trading is a mug’s game.Americans also appear to be less willing than in previous booms to let the rise in stock market wealth on paper lead to a surge in spending. Family savings rates have stayed stubbornly high by historical standards.“Households continue to kind of treat their capital gains, realized or unrealized, more cautiously than they did in the 1990s or the 2000s,” said Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at J.P. Morgan.In part, this is because many stock owners are baby boomers, who might have enjoyed spending their stock market gains 20 years ago but are now more worried about preserving wealth as they retire. Fred Wallace, a 64-year-old retired HBO executive in Los Angeles is one of them. When the stock market took a dive in December, he cut his holdings of stock and moved money into cash and bonds.“That allows you to sleep at night because you know that if stocks tank it doesn’t really matter,” Mr. Wallace said. But even among Americans who are just starting their careers, this risk-aversion could linger. Research from Ms. Malmendier and Mr. Nagel, the economists, suggests that enduring financial traumas at a relatively young age can shape people’s behavior for decades. Younger Americans, Ms. Malmendier said, are unlikely to be eager to take big risks in the stock market any time soon.“We don’t see that happening,” she said. “People were scarred from that experience.”The buoyant jobs market that has helped sustain American households for the better part of a decade did not go anywhere.After an unexpectedly weak February — just 20,000 new jobs were initially reported — concerns arose that the remarkable wave of hiring might be ebbing. But employment surged again last month, beating the expectations of most economists with 196,000 new jobs, the Labor Department said Friday.Even lowly February looked better: The department revised its report upward to 33,000 jobs. And unemployment remained at 3.8 percent in March, while wage growth kept its momentum, ensuring that pay is growing faster than inflation.“We think the labor market is the strongest thing in the U.S. economy right now,” said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. “We’re encouraged by the wage gains.”The economy has now produced more than 21 million new jobs since the labor market bottomed out in 2010, and the unemployment rate has plunged from a peak of 10 percent in October 2009.But in recent months, economists have seen reasons to doubt the strength of the economy. The invigorating effects of the tax cuts enacted at the end of 2017 are expected to fade. Large overseas economies have slowed, in part a reaction to continuing trade tensions. And while the stock market has rallied since a rout at the end of last year, other important financial indicators — such as government bond yields — suggest that investors expect growth to moderate.President Trump contends that the Federal Reserve slowed the economy last year by pushing interest rates too high, and has said he intends to nominate the conservative economist Stephen Moore and the former pizza chain executive Herman Cain to the central bank’s board. “I personally think the Fed should drop rates,” Mr. Trump said on Friday.Mr. Trump won’t necessarily get his way on interest rates. The Fed has already taken a softer stance: As recently as December, the central bank said it could raise rates in 2019, but it has since signaled that it probably wouldn’t do so. Economists said the latest jobs report showed that the Fed’s willingness to hold interest rates at current levels was probably the right response for the economy. “It doesn’t tell the Fed that it’s doing the wrong thing by remaining patient,” said Ellen Zentner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley. The March jobs gain probably won’t be enough to dispel all the pessimism, though. The report contained evidence of a slowdown in manufacturing, a sector that has performed well over the past two years. Manufacturers shed 6,000 jobs in March, driven mostly by the auto sector, and added just 1,000 in February. Last year, the sector on average added 22,000 jobs a month. Some manufacturers have been hit by tariffs imposed by other countries in response to those put in place by Mr. Trump. Rob Parmentier, chief executive of Marquis Yachts in Green Bay, Wis., said sales to some of the company’s biggest export markets had stalled as a result of the tariffs. “There’s a chance we’d have to lay people off if we don’t get these tariffs fixed,” Mr. Parmentier said. “I understand what the president’s doing, but he’s got to do it faster, or get a better perspective on what he’s doing to American companies.”While the March jobs number exceeded expectations — economists surveyed by FactSet predicted, on average, around 170,000 new jobs — job growth has slowed. In the first three months of the year, the economy added 180,000 jobs on average, down from a monthly average of 223,000 for all of 2018.But some economists did not see slower hiring as a cause for concern. “The number from last year was not sustainable,” said Martha Gimbel, research director at the job-search site Indeed. “What’s more surprising is that we’re still adding an average of 180,000 jobs at this point in a recovery.”Hiring was strong in some sectors: Professional and business services, which cover a broad swath of white-collar positions, added 37,000 jobs in March. Health care services added 61,000, bringing the total over the past 12 months to about half a million new jobs.But it was the wage growth revealed in the jobs report that provided perhaps the strongest reason for optimism. For years, even as the economy added jobs and unemployment kept falling, wage increases were lackluster. But employees now appear to be getting solid raises. Hourly wages in March were 3.2 percent higher than a year earlier, slightly lower than the 3.4 percent growth in February but still roughly double the annual inflation rate. And some economists said the slight decline in growth was no cause for concern. “It’s a volatile number; it tends to bounce up and down,” Ms. Gimbel said. “What’s more important is that we’ve had six straight months above 3 percent.”Steady wage growth may be the catalyst that helps keep the economic expansion going: Higher wages encourage more spending, and companies that wish to meet that consumer demand have to hire more people. Firms in the leisure and hospitality sector have particularly benefited from people having more money to spend: Those businesses added 33,000 jobs in March. Sean Moloney, owner of My Bartender, a company in Portland, Ore., that provides bartenders and drinks at events, said he expected to hire 40 to 50 people during this year’s busy season, compared with around 15 people five years ago. And his customers are also spending more on the drinks served.“People are willing to spend the extra money to get something other than the bargain brand,” he said.ISTANBUL — Turkey’s banking regulator has announced that it will begin an inquiry into JPMorgan Chase for providing “misleading and manipulative” investment advice that, it said, prompted a run on the Turkish lira last week.The Banking Regulation and Supervision Board issued a statement saying it had received a large number of complaints about a JPMorgan research report to clients on Friday that “caused volatility in the financial markets and loss of reputation and value especially for the banks of our country.”The lira, which has been slipping in value over the last year, slumped more than 5 percent on Friday, dropping in value to 5.7 to the United States dollar from 5.4, while Turkey’s main stock exchange fell 3.45 percent.The board said its investigation would also look into activities of other banks, but it did not name them.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has frequently accused foreign powers of orchestrating the currency crisis, and at a huge campaign rally in Istanbul on Sunday, he accused unnamed actors in the financial sector of trying to provoke a run on the lira.“We all know who you are, we all know what you are all doing,” he said. “You should know that after the elections, we will make you to pay a heavy price. You would not be able to exploit this nation. You would not be able to cheat this nation.”Economists, though, say a loss of confidence in the management of the economy and rule of law in Turkey is behind the weakening of the lira.It is unclear how the inquiry will progress or what penalties could be imposed, but the board said it would undertake “necessary administrative and legal proceedings.” In a related announcement, the Capital Markets Board of Turkey said it was conducting its own investigation into JPMorgan over the same report.JPMorgan analysts warned in the report that the Turkish lira might depreciate soon after local elections scheduled for Sunday. A spokesman for JPMorgan declined to comment.In a sign of its concern at the renewed volatility in financial markets, Turkey’s Central Bank announced on Friday that it would suspend one-week repo auctions — closing the spigot on one source of cash for banks — for a period of time, which analysts called an unusual move.Turkey has experienced severe economic pressures over the last year, and government figures released this month showed that the country had entered a recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth. The lira lost 28 percent of its value last year as foreign investment stalled amid soaring private sector debt.Mr. Erdogan, who has assumed increased powers since winning re-election last summer, announced that he would take on greater responsibility for the economy and even decisions at the Central Bank. He appointed Berat Albayrak, his son-in-law, minister of finance and Treasury.Mr. Albayrak said in a television interview on Friday that Turkey had already resolved its most pressing vulnerabilities: inflation and budget discipline. “A healthy environment that would provide security for international markets has settled in Turkey,” he said, promising a period of reform over the rest of Mr. Erdogan’s five-year term. “Our way is open. We are very comfortable.”Even as inflation and unemployment figures have risen sharply, Mr. Erdogan has been undeterred, personally leading two or three rallies around the country a day for his Justice and Development Party. The election campaign has been especially nasty, with mudslinging and lawsuits leveled at candidates as polls show a close race in some of the most important cities, including the capital, Ankara.At the campaign rally on Sunday, Mr. Erdogan vowed to fight outside influences trying to weaken the economy.“Beware, folks, do not take their words for it,” he said. “We will protect our money. Our money is the Turkish lira. We will protect it. We will not rise to the bait. And we will make them pay the price.”For mutual-fund investors, the fourth quarter of 2018 was a hailstorm — a stinging deluge in which nearly every sort of investment seemed to get plunked.Yet several top-performing funds managed to find refuge in far-flung corners of the market, like Latin American companies, real estate investment trusts and dividend-paying stocks.T. Rowe Price Latin America Verena E. Wachnitz, portfolio manager of the T. Rowe Price Latin America Fund, was spared the fourth quarter’s party of pain because of where she invests: Latin America was one of the few major markets that rose late last year.Brazil accounted for much of that gain. It endured a severe recession in 2015 and 2016 and anemic growth in 2017. But a stronger recovery began last year, and the Brazilian Bovespa stock index gained 15 percent in 2018.Brazil is Latin America’s biggest economy, and its stocks account for more than 60 percent of the MSCI Emerging Markets Latin America index, so Ms. Wachnitz keeps a big chunk of her shareholders’ money there.“Brazil has a lot of high-quality companies,” she said. “Whatever happens there is key for the region.” Seven of her fund’s top 10 holdings are Brazilian, including two banks, Itaú Unibanco and Banco Bradesco, and an apparel retailer, Lojas Renner.The banks, two of Brazil’s heftiest, are profiting as consumers start to borrow and spend more with the recovery, Ms. Wachnitz said.Lojas Renner likewise stands to gain from a surge in consumer spending. “They’re really going into the digital age, and the consumer experience improves every year,” she said. “Now you can check out directly with employees who have hand-held devices.”Ms. Wachnitz has also benefited from where she chose not to invest: She shied from Mexico, because of concerns about how the policies of its new government might affect the profitability of its companies. Mexican shares make up only 14.6 percent of her fund, compared with 21.6 percent of the index. The S&P BMV IPC, a leading Mexico stock index, lost 15.27 percent last quarter.“I’m not that worried about trade and Trump,” she said. “The new trade agreement is moving forward. But policymaking is deteriorating in Mexico, with a more populist, left-wing type of government.”Ms. Wachnitz’s fund, with a net expense ratio of 1.29 percent, returned 6.01 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of 13.52 percent, including dividends, for the S&P 500. The quarter’s punishments weren’t limited to the S&P 500 and Mexico: Nearly every stock-market sector tracked by Morningstar recorded a loss.MFS Diversified IncomeMFS Diversified Income didn’t manage a gain in the fourth quarter: It lost 3.79 percent. But it still outpaced all but a few competitors by spreading its bets around on income-producing securities. The fund, with an expense ratio of 0.99 percent, aims to “out-yield the equity market but outgrow the bond market and hopefully do so with less volatility,” said Robert M. Almeida, its lead portfolio manager. To do this, it owns both stocks and bonds.On the stock side, Mr. Almeida divides his shareholders’ money among real estate investment trusts and dividend payers and, on the bond side, investment-grade, high-yield and emerging-market debt.His starting point is an allocation of 20 percent of the fund’s assets to each of these asset classes — R.E.I.T.s, dividend payers and investment-grade bonds — as well as 25 percent to high-yield bonds and 15 percent to emerging-markets bonds. He then tweaks the precise weight of each by consulting with MFS’s other portfolio managers and its analysts. “In the fourth quarter, we were overweight emerging-market debt and R.E.I.T.s and underweight high-yield debt and global dividend-paying stocks,” he said.Those emerging-markets bonds represent a wager that the finances of some of the developing world’s governments are safer than the markets may appreciate. Mr. Almeida said many investors fixate on the economic trouble spots in the emerging world, like recently Venezuela and Turkey.“What doesn’t get talked about is Chile and Peru, which are fundamentally strong countries. I don’t think of them as high risk. High-yield debt is risk. There, you’re lending to the lower-quality end of the U.S. corporate market, which is going to have to refinance a lot of debt at higher rates over the next two to three years.”Mr. Almeida said his R.E.I.T. bet stemmed partly from a presentation made by Richard R. Gable, portfolio manager of the MFS Global Real Estate Fund. “Rick was saying the R.E.I.T. sector was the cheapest it’d been, relative to financials and the rest of the equity market, in years,” he said.Among R.E.I.T.s, Mr. Almeida said, MFS prefers those “with properties that are really hard to replicate.” His fund’s top real estate holdings include the Simon Property Group, the United States’ largest shopping-mall owner, and AvalonBay Communities, an apartment owner that is strong in coastal urban markets.American Funds College 2024 and College 2027 The American Funds College 2024 Fund and College 2027 Fund also buy both stocks and bonds. The two target-date college funds don’t invest directly in those securities but do so through other funds in the American family, which is managed by the Capital Group. Both college funds, for example, hold shares of the American Mutual Fund and the Bond Fund of America, which have been part of the American lineup for decades.The college funds are investment options in CollegeAmerica, a 529 college-savings plan sponsored by the state of Virginia. (That “529” refers to a provision of the United States Internal Revenue Code, and anyone can invest in the funds, not just Virginians, though the tax benefits may differ for people in other states.) The 2024 fund lost 1.27 percent in the fourth quarter, while the 2027 fund lost 3.26 percent. The 2024 fund has an expense ratio of 0.73 percent, while the 2027 has one of 0.8 percent.Wesley K.-S. Phoa, principal investment officer for American Funds’ target-date college funds series, said the funds’ bond investments didn’t carry excessive credit risk or unexpected correlations with the stock market, while the stock investments emphasized sturdiness, not sizzle. “We’ve picked stock funds that focus on solid blue-chip dividend payers, and that has delivered the resilience we hoped it would,” he said.Mr. Phoa said college funds present an unusual asset-allocation challenge in that investors — often parents — are seeking the savings growth that stocks can bring but they typically have only about 15 years to achieve that. That gives them less time to ride out down markets, like the fourth quarter’s thumping.“Most parents make steady modest contributions, and a lot start when their kids are 6 or 7,” he said. “When you’re putting in modest amounts, you want to get as much growth as you can. So we’re pretty growth oriented for a young beneficiary. But once you get within a couple of years in college enrollment, that’s the last thing you want. So at this stage, we’re invested very conservatively.”For the 2024 fund, whose intended beneficiaries are now 13 to 15 years old, that translates to about 68 percent bonds, 26 percent stocks and 6 percent cash. For the 2027 fund, whose intended beneficiaries are now 10 to 12, that translates to 54 percent bonds, 41 percent stocks and 5 percent cash.Mr. Phoa said he has recently gained a new appreciation of the stresses his clients face, because his own daughter is 16 and thinking about college. “Once you get within a couple of years in college enrollment, the last thing you want to discuss is what’s happening in the 529 account.”The Sacklers had a new plan.It was 2014, and the company the family had controlled for two generations, Purdue Pharma, had been hit with years of investigations and lawsuits over its marketing of the highly addictive opioid painkiller OxyContin, at one point pleading guilty to a federal felony and paying more than $600 million in criminal and civil penalties.But as the country’s addiction crisis worsened, the Sacklers spied another business opportunity. They could increase their profits by selling treatments for the very problem their company had helped to create: addiction to opioids.Details of the effort, named Project Tango, have come to light in lawsuits filed by the attorneys general of Massachusetts and New York. Together, the cases lay out the extensive involvement of a family that has largely escaped personal legal consequences for Purdue Pharma’s role in an epidemic that has led to hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths in the past two decades.ImageRichard SacklerThe filings cite numerous records, emails and other documents showing that members of the family continued to push aggressively to expand the market for OxyContin and other opioids for years after the company admitted in a 2007 plea deal that it had misrepresented the drug’s addictive qualities and potential for abuse.[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]The business potential of adding addiction treatment to the mix was illustrated in internal company charts and diagrams.“Pain treatment and addiction are naturally linked,” one Project Tango document, included in the New York complaint, said. It depicted a big blue funnel. The fat end was labeled “pain treatment”; the narrow end was labeled “opioid addiction treatment.”The company, the document said, could make money at both ends of the funnel as an “end-to-end pain provider.” Dr. Kathe Sackler, one of the eight family members sitting on Purdue’s board, instructed employees to devote “immediate attention” to the effort, according to an email included in the Massachusetts filing.The two lawsuits are part of a burst of recent litigation that has taken aim at the Sacklers, a far-flung billionaire family that has a network of trusts and companies in the United States and abroad. Their philanthropic gifts have built namesake wings housing the Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and oriental antiquities at the Louvre in Paris, as well as a library at the University of Oxford and a scientific institute at Columbia University.In addition to New York and Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Utah have filed suit against members of the family. Last month, a coalition of more than 500 counties, cities and Native American tribes named the Sacklers in a case in the Southern District of New York, bringing the family into a bundle of 1,600 opioids cases being overseen by a federal court judge in Cleveland.(The various legal claims also identify many other manufacturers, distributors and pharmacy chains as bearing responsibility for the epidemic.)The suits are not only an effort to get at the Sacklers’ personal fortunes — estimated by Forbes to be $13 billion — but to expose the extent to which the Sacklers themselves have been calling the shots.“If these allegations against the Sacklers are proven to be correct, that could dramatically change the potential reach of where the litigation goes to collect funds on behalf of the cities and states that are so desperately trying to get money to deal with the opioid crisis,” said Adam Zimmerman, an expert on complex litigation at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.In a joint statement to The New York Times, representatives of the eight Sackler family members named as defendants in the New York and Massachusetts cases said the lawsuits were “filled with claims that are demonstrably false and unsupportable by the actual facts.” The statement also contended that the claims would be refuted by the family’s response this week to the Massachusetts lawsuit.The statement said the lawsuits “ignore the fact that the Sackler family has long been committed to initiatives that prevent abuse and addiction,” citing what it characterized as a philanthropic donation from the family to an addiction research and treatment center in Tulsa, Okla. In fact, the $75 million contribution, to be made over five years, was a condition of the court-approved settlement of an opioid lawsuit brought by the Oklahoma attorney general against Purdue.Regarding Project Tango, a separate statement from some of the Sacklers named in the suits said that “no board member proposed Tango, or authored any documents in support of it.”Purdue, for its part, said in a court filing in Massachusetts this year that it “neither created nor caused the opioid epidemic” there and in a statement last week said the company and its former directors “vigorously deny” the New York claims.Prescription opioids are Food and Drug Administration-approved medications that have legitimate uses for certain patients with advanced cancer or short-term severely acute pain, and are still prescribed, despite limited evidence, for some patients with chronic pain.A central concern of the investigations and legal cases against Purdue Pharma over the years, including the 2007 federal investigation, has been whether the company, its executives and owners were aware in the late 1990s that OxyContin was being abused. The new lawsuits are notable for the detail they provide about the family’s own continued push to sell opioids in more recent years, as the opioid epidemic became a full-blown national crisis.In 2009, two years after the federal guilty plea, Mortimer D.A. Sackler, a board member, demanded to know why the company wasn’t selling more opioids, email traffic cited by Massachusetts prosecutors showed.ImageTheresa SacklerCreditDavid M. Benett/Getty ImagesIn 2011, as states looked for ways to curb opioid prescriptions, family members peppered the sales staff with questions about how to expand the market for the drugs. Mortimer asked if they could sell a generic version of OxyContin in order to “capture more cost sensitive patients,” according to one email. Kathe, his half sister, suggested studying patients who had switched to OxyContin to see if they could find patterns that could help them win new customers, according to court filings in Massachusetts.The family’s statement said they were just acting as responsible board members, raising questions about “business issues that were highly relevant to doctors and patients.”In July 2011, Mortimer and Kathe’s cousin Dr. Richard Sackler, who had stepped down as Purdue’s president several years earlier but remained an influential board member, went into the field with a sales representative to promote opioids to doctors, though some in the company were concerned that his involvement could run afoul of regulators, according to documents in the Massachusetts case.When he returned, he argued in an email to Purdue’s vice president for sales that a legally required warning about opioids wasn’t needed, and that it “implies a danger of untoward reactions and hazards that simply aren’t there.”(The family’s statement disputed that, saying that Richard supported accurate labeling, and merely questioned where on the label the warning should appear. The statement also said he had not been out in the field with sales representatives since well before the launch of OxyContin, in 1996.)In 2014, Raymond Sackler, now deceased, sent three other family members a confidential memo about Purdue’s strategy for placing patients on high doses of opioids for extended periods of time. The memo noted that doctors had argued against the practice, but that Purdue had beaten back efforts to impose caps on doses, according to the Massachusetts complaint.The next year, Jonathan Sackler, then a board member, sought information about how public health campaigns to curb opioid addiction would affect OxyContin sales. In 2017, he pushed to develop a new opioid, and asked the staff to present a plan at the next Purdue board meeting.From laxatives to painkillersIt was Arthur Sackler, a psychiatrist and pharmaceutical marketing guru who helped pioneer the infomercial, who started the family business dynasty. In 1952, he and his two younger brothers, Mortimer and Raymond (who were also psychiatrists and who have since died), bought a small company called Purdue Frederick. Their first products included laxatives and a prescription earwax remover, as recounted in the book “Pain Killer” by Barry Meier, a former New York Times reporter.ImageJonathan SacklerCreditSylvain Gaboury/PatrickMcmullan.comThe sprawling family today is hardly monolithic. Arthur’s branch has not been involved in Purdue for many years, and one of his children, Elizabeth A. Sackler, has called Purdue Pharma’s role in the opioid crisis “morally abhorrent.” But reporting published last year by ProPublica and The Atlantic suggested that Arthur’s side of the family may have reaped some financial benefit from Purdue after OxyContin hit the market.The lawsuits brought by the attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts, Letitia James and Maura Healey, named eight Sackler family members: Kathe, Mortimer, Richard, Jonathan and Ilene Sackler Lefcourt — children of either Mortimer or Raymond Sackler — along with Theresa Sackler, the elder Mortimer’s widow; Beverly Sackler, Raymond’s widow; and David Sackler, a grandson of Raymond.Purdue’s business was fundamentally changed after the F.D.A. approved OxyContin in 1995. The company marketed the drug as a long-acting painkiller that was less addictive than shorter-acting rivals like Percocet and Vicodin, a strategy aimed at reducing the stigma attached to opioids among doctors.The court filings detailed a multipronged approach used by the pharmaceutical industry at that time to reshape public perceptions about pain and chip away at physicians’ reluctance to prescribe opioids, long known to be addictive, by describing an “epidemic” of untreated pain affecting 100 million Americans.Manufacturers funded “front groups” that were “disguised as ‘unbiased’ sources of cutting-edge medical research and information,” according to the New York attorney general’s office, ostensibly to educate the public about chronic pain and the benefits of opioids. Physicians were paid as consultants to further spread their message. The companies claimed that opioids were safer than high doses of acetaminophen and other anti-inflammatory agents and that there was a minuscule risk of addiction.At Purdue, sales representatives focused on doctors who were high-volume opioid prescribers, as well as inexperienced providers and primary care physicians who knew little about pain management, encouraging them to prescribe higher and higher doses for longer stretches of time, according to the court filings. Sales representatives could earn tens of thousands of dollars in bonuses and were rewarded with trips to tropical islands.Since OxyContin came on the market, more than 200,000 Americans have died of overdoses related to prescription opioids. As reports of overdoses grew, Richard Sackler urged the company to blame the patients. “We have to hammer on abusers in every way possible,” he wrote in a 2001 email disclosed in documents filed in the Massachusetts case. “They are the culprits and the problem. They are reckless criminals.”That year, after a federal prosecutor highlighted 59 OxyContin-related deaths in one state, Mr. Sackler wrote: “This is not too bad. It could have been far worse.”ImageMortimer D.A. SacklerCreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty ImagesThe same year Purdue lawyers negotiated the federal guilty plea, the Sacklers quietly formed a new company to sell generic opioids, called Rhodes, according to the New York lawsuit.“Rhodes was set up as a ‘landing pad’ for the Sackler family in 2007, to prepare for the possibility that they would need to start afresh following the crisis then engulfing OxyContin,” the suit quotes a former senior manager at Purdue as saying.The Sacklers were intimately involved in overseeing and approving Rhodes’s activities, court records show. They saw the agendas for board of directors meetings and the financial statements. In the years that followed, Theresa, Kathe and Jonathan Sackler would serve on Rhodes’s governance committee, according to the New York lawsuit, while Kathe, Jonathan, Mortimer and David served on its business development committee.The business operations of Rhodes, based in Rhode Island, and Purdue, based in Connecticut, were closely enmeshed. Rhodes relied on Purdue to oversee its compliance with government regulations, ensuring the quality and safety of its products, the New York lawsuit says, providing, for example, statistics and data to Rhodes’s compliance committee for review.Rhodes made monetary distributions to two companies that were ultimately owned by trusts set up for the Sacklers: the Rosebay Medical Company and the Beacon Company.While the Sacklers “have reduced Purdue’s operations and size, Rhodes continues to grow and sell opioids for the benefit of the Sackler families,” the New York suit contends.By 2016, Rhodes, though little known to the public, had a greater share of the American prescription opioid market than Purdue, according to a Financial Times analysis. Together, the companies ranked seventh in terms of the market share of opioids.Purdue temporarily abandoned plans to pursue Project Tango in 2014, but revived the idea two years later, this time pursuing a plan to sell naloxone, an overdose-reversing drug, according to the Massachusetts filing. A few months later, in December 2016, Richard, Jonathan and Mortimer Sackler discussed buying a company that used implantable drug pumps to treat opioid addiction.In recent years, the Sacklers and their companies have been developing products for opioid and overdose treatment on various tracks. Last year, Richard Sackler was awarded a patent for a version of buprenorphine, a drug that blocks opioid receptors, administered by mouth in a thin film. In March, the F.D.A. fast tracked the company’s application for an injectable drug for emergency treatment of overdoses.Purdue has said it is taking charitable steps to curb opioid addiction, and last year donated $3.4 million to a nonprofit developing a nasal spray that uses the drug naloxone to treat opioid overdoses.But the funnel that Purdue once described is full, and overflowing at both ends. David Sackler spent a reported $22.5 million on a Bel Air mansion last year. Mortimer’s Amagansett spread has been featured in Vogue. Theresa Sackler was made a dame and is a trustee of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.Last week, three Democratic senators from states hit hard by the opioid epidemic, Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, sent a letter to Purdue, insisting that it make a more formal commitment not to make money from the treatments.“Indeed,” they wrote, “it is a maxim of the common law in this country that no one should be allowed to profit from his own wrongdoing.”(Reuters) - United Arab Emirates-based payments and foreign exchange company Finablr said on Tuesday it expects to register to launch an initial public offering in London, in a deal that could raise proceeds of $200 million (£152.7 million).Finablr, the holding company for businesses including UAE Exchange, Travelex Holdings and Xpress Money, said any offer it made would consist of new shares and existing shares to be sold by some of its investors.The company intends to use the net proceeds to finance expansion plans and reduce net debt, it said. (Reporting by Noor Zainab Hussain in Bengaluru; editing by Patrick Graham)Armchair investors have been selling stock. So have pension funds and mutual funds, as well as a whole other category of investors — nonprofit groups, endowments, private equity firms and personal trusts. The stock market is off to its best start since 1987, but these investors are expected to dump hundreds of billions of dollars of shares this year.So who is pushing prices higher? In part, the companies themselves. American corporations flush with cash from last year’s tax cuts and a growing economy are buying back their own shares at an extraordinary clip. They have good reason: Buybacks allow them to return cash to shareholders, burnish key measures of financial performance and goose their share prices.The surge in buybacks reflects a fundamental shift in how the market is operating, cementing the position of corporations as the single largest source of demand for American stocks. The binge has helped sustain a bull market approaching its 10th birthday, even in the face of political, international and economic uncertainty. Since the market rally began in March 2009, the S&P 500 has risen more than 300 percent as the United States recovered from the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. But few expect those kinds of gains over the next decade. Facing the prospect of a period of relatively low returns — or even a bear market for stocks — many investors are eager to protect their gains or to find more appealing investments, like emerging markets and corporate bonds, outside the American stock market. “There’s no reason to be a hog,” said Rich Robben, interim chief investment officer of the Kentucky Retirement Systems, which manages more than $17 billion in the state’s retirement and insurance funds. “We’ve all eaten at the public equity trough very well for 10 years now. And we felt it was just time to reduce that exposure a bit.”Mr. Robben said his pension fund, which pays benefits to more than 100,000 retired state and county workers, has been cutting its stake in the domestic stock market for 18 months. Such prudence paid off late last year, when concerns about a sluggish global economy, rising interest rates and slowing corporate profits hit the market. The S&P 500 fell 14 percent in the fourth quarter, and 9 percent in December alone. That was the worst monthly performance since February 2009, and badly shook investor confidence. Since the worst of the sell-off, on Dec. 24, the S&P 500 is up roughly 19 percent. But data show that many investors remain nervous: In every week this year, money has flowed out of domestic stock market mutual funds and exchange-traded funds — as much as $15 billion in the last week of January, according to EPFR Global, which tracks flows into and out of funds. These investors, overwhelmingly individuals, have moved money into bonds and cash. Henry Crutcher has missed a bit of the rebound. Mr. Crutcher, a 44-year-old software company owner in Atlanta, saw December’s crack in the stock market as a buying opportunity and moved roughly 10 percent of his portfolio from cash into a Russell 2000 exchange-traded fund. After enjoying a couple weeks of rising stock prices, he sold it, missing much of the roughly 10 percent of additional gains that have come since mid-January.“Right now I’m partially invested,” Mr. Crutcher said. “I’m not totally sitting on the sidelines. But I’m more on the sidelines than I think I should be.”Survey data suggests portfolio managers at many mutual funds and hedge funds have also been skittish about chasing the market higher. A survey of global fund managers by Bank of America Merrill Lynch this month reported that those holding more money in cash than usual outnumbered their stock-friendly counterparts by 44 percentage points — the biggest margin since January 2009. Such statistics suggest that many investors failed to capitalize on the sharp snapback in stocks early this year. “The speed of the rally is uncomfortable,” said Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “To turn from a seller to a buyer in a week is, again, psychologically very tough for people.”Corporations, however, don’t seem to be experiencing such angst. In the fourth quarter last year, American companies bought an estimated $240 billion of their own shares, according to an analysis by the Goldman Sachs team that handles stock buybacks for major companies. That’s nearly 60 percent higher than during the same period in 2017. More buybacks are coming. The Union Pacific railroad has bought nearly $32 billion in its own shares since 2007, and this month authorized buying over $20 billion more. The tech equipment giant Cisco has spent roughly $20 billion on buybacks in the past year, and has authorizations to spend another $24 billion. And Bank of America, which planned to buy $20 billion of its own shares by the end of June, just added $2.5 billion on top of that, the bank said this month.Besides returning cash to shareholders, buybacks offer companies two crucial benefits. They increase demand for a stock, helping to prop up share prices. Buybacks also improve a key gauge of profitability closely tracked by investors and analysts: When a company buys back shares, the same profits are spread over the smaller number of shares still outstanding, improving their earnings-per-share number. So far this year, companies have announced plans to repurchase a total of more than $190 billion of their own shares. That is only slightly behind last year’s pace of buyback announcements. And last year was a record for buybacks, as companies, in part thanks to the Trump administration’s tax cut, gobbled $910 billion of their shares, according to an analysis by Goldman Sachs. Before the early 1980s, buying shares with corporate money was considered a legal gray area because it might open a company up to charges of manipulating its share price. In 1982, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a rule that allowed share repurchases, provided they followed certain rules.Since then, stock buybacks have largely replaced dividends as companies’ preferred way to return to shareholders the cash they can’t spend productively. Shareholders like buybacks because they reduce the numbers of shares outstanding, which results in each remaining share being worth a bigger slice of the company. Taxes on buybacks can also be deferred until investors sell the shares, which are then taxed as capital gains. While share buybacks tend to increase companies’ share prices, critics blame them for stymieing corporate investment, hiring and wages. They argue that when a company spends its cash on buybacks, it leaves less money available for long-term capital spending and wages. Supporters of buybacks argue, however, that companies won’t make new investments or increase hiring if they don’t see a profitable reason to do so. They contend that banning buybacks would simply result in higher dividend payments and corporate cash holdings or a surge in mergers and acquisitions. Senators Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, and Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, said this month that they planned to introduce legislation that would limit buybacks for companies that did not pay their workers at least a $15 an hour, among other criteria. Also this month, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said he planned to introduce a bill that would change the preferential tax treatment of buybacks, though the details of such an approach remain unclear. But even if such proposals were enacted — and few Republicans have voiced support for Mr. Rubio’s idea — it’s not clear that they would derail the stock market’s ever-higher march. A number of other factors — most notably the Federal Reserve’s abrupt turn away from its clockwork pattern of interest-rate increases — have combined to restore confidence since the brutal sell-off that left the S&P 500 down nearly 20 percent for the year on Christmas Eve.The arrival of a solid, if unspectacular, batch of fourth-quarter earnings reports also quelled some investors’ fears about the outlook for the global economy and corporate profits.But the persistent flow of corporate money into the stock market has been a pivotal element in its recent rise. “Buybacks are likely the No. 1 cause,” said Brian Reynolds, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, a Canadian asset management and brokerage firm. Buybacks’ importance to the rally means any legislative push that results in less activity could act as a headwind to stocks, said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at the brokerage firm Weeden & Company. But if such changes don’t gain a foothold, corporate buying will most likely remain a cornerstone of the stock market in the coming years. This year alone, Goldman Sachs analysts estimated, corporations will be by far the largest buyer of shares, with net purchases of $700 billion. Traditional investors like mutual funds, pensions, endowments and individuals are expected to be net sellers, parting with roughly $400 billion in shares. NEW YORK — With U.S. stocks a stone's throw away from hitting a record high, Wall Street's so-called "fear gauge" slipped to a fresh six-month low on Friday, in a sign investors expect the good times to keep rolling.The S&P 500 crossed the 2,900 mark for the first time since early October on Friday, boosted by a jump in Walt Disney shares and as bank stocks surged after strong results from JPMorgan Chase & Co.The stock index's recent gains spell a striking reversal in fortunes for investors, who just a few months ago had been staring at the demise of the longest bull market for stocks.Stocks tumbled hard late last year, as investors fretted over mounting concerns about global growth, waning corporate profits, U.S.-China trade tensions and the Fed's path on rate hikes.But you wouldn't know that looking at the Cboe Volatility Index today. On Friday the VIX - a widely followed options-based barometer of expected near-term volatility for stocks - slipped as low as 12.11, its lowest since October 5.That was shortly after the S&P logged its highest ever close at 2,929.67 on Sept 21, and marked the beginning of what became a near 20% correction to a low near 2,351 on Christmas Eve that saw the VIX spike above 36.Investors' forecast for low volatility is in line with how stocks have been moving of late. One-month historical volatility for the S&P 500 index - a measure of daily gyrations - is close to the lowest it has been since October. Some Wall Street analysts say stocks have room to run.Equity exposure for volatility targeting portfolios and hedge funds are low and retail investors have yet to return to U.S. equity funds after record outflows in December, JPMorgan analysts Bram Kaplan and Shawn Quigg said in a note on Friday. "Despite the fact that the market is closing in on record highs, systematic and macro investors have a long way to go in terms of re-levering their portfolios," the analysts said.The return of these types of investors to stocks can continue for the next couple of months and support the market, they said.Despite the stock market turmoil late last year, traders are discounting volatility, citing historical trade patterns."Once a cyclical correction within a secular bull market is over, the next rally tends to be strong," said technical analysts at BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research said in a note on Thursday.The amount of time for the S&P 500 to regain the high from the start of the cyclical correction within a secular bull market averages 15.4 months, according to BofA Merrill Lynch data."If 2351 from 12/24 proves to be the correction low on the S&P 500, this suggests that the S&P 500 could achieve a new high in January 2020 given the start of the correction in September," the BofA analysts said.

We are optimistic and hope to see the turning point appear in around July and August" said Xu Haidong, assistant secretary general at CAAM, the country's biggest auto industry association.Recent government cuts to value-added tax (VAT) are expected to further benefit car sales, Xu added. "The VAT cut can drive production and employment, so an effective implementation of the policy can bring warmth to the market." China has cut VAT for the manufacturing sector to 13 percent from 16 percent, prompting some car makers such as BMW and Mercedes-Benz to lower prices."We expect China's auto market to see positive growth in the third quarter and a relatively large increase in the fourth," said Alan Kang, Shanghai-based analyst at LMC Automotive. In 2018, China's car market hit reverse for the first time since the 1990s against a backdrop of slowing economic growth and a crippling Sino-U.S. trade war.However, new energy vehicle (NEV) sales have remained a bright spot, jumping almost 62 percent last year even as the broader auto market contracted.Last month, NEV sales rose 85.4 percent to 126,000 units, the CAAM said.China has been a keen supporter of NEV - pure battery electric, hybrid and plug-in hybrids - and has started implementing NEV sales quota requirements for automakers.After rolling out a generous 5-year NEV subsidy programme in 2016 to support sales and encourage innovation, Beijing recently pledged to phase it out by 2020 and raise standards for vehicles eligible for subsidies amid criticism some firms have become too reliant on the funds. (Reporting by Beijing newsroom, Yilei Sun and Brenda Goh in Shanghai; Editing by Himani Sarkar)The new jobs numbers reported Friday are not spectacular by the standards of the last couple of years. But they also signify a sigh of relief.A weak job growth number in February had appeared to be the most solid evidence yet that the United States economy was slowing, and perhaps even that the expansion might be near an end. The Labor Department originally reported that employers added a mere 20,000 jobs that month. Even after new revisions, that number came in at only 33,000.The March number — 196,000 positions added last month — makes clear that February was an aberration, not a trend. For all the fluctuations in financial markets and pessimistic commentary at the end of last year, the great American job creation machine is still humming.Over the last six months, the economy has averaged 207,000 new jobs a month, which is actually better than the results in 2017 and only slightly behind the rates of 2018.But even as the numbers give some assurance that the economy isn’t falling off a cliff, there’s nothing in it that will give the Federal Reserve reason to reconsider its approach on interest rates.Average hourly earnings rose only 0.1 percent in March, and are up 3.2 percent over the last year. Inflation is low enough that this represents rising incomes for American workers. But this is hardly the stuff of an inflationary outbreak that the Fed will feel compelled to stop with an increase in interest rates.The Fed, which has decided to put off rate increases indefinitely, has become increasingly comfortable with a tight labor market and jobless rates that, in the past, it would have viewed as a precursor to overheating. With the March rate at 3.8 percent, the jobless rate has been at 4 percent or lower for a full year.The stable unemployment rate in March masked negative trends in the share of Americans looking for work. The labor force participation rate fell by 0.2 of a percentage point, and the ratio of the adult population working fell by 0.1 percent.That is probably a statistical aberration, but taken at face value it implies that the progress toward pulling more Americans into the work force has not been as consistent and compelling as it had seemed.Combined with other significant data points — like surveys of business activity and retail sales — the latest readings on the labor market support the idea that this is a resilient economy. In December, a sharp sell-off in the stock market coincided with a rise in pessimism in surveys of business leaders.The report is a reminder that even if growth slows in 2019, which forecasters expect, a slowdown is not the same as a recession, and certainly not the same as a collapse. So far, the ominous signs about the economy — such as longer-term interest rates falling below some short-term rates, and weak reports on retail sales in December and on the labor market in February — are not reasons to panic.In other words, as long as employers ignore the latest fluctuations in financial markets and make their hiring and investment decisions based on demand for their products (which is strong) and availability of credit (which is easy), this expansion should have room to run yet.SHANGHAI — Geely, China's highest profile car maker with investments in Volvo and Daimler, launched a premium all-electric car brand "Geometry" on Thursday as it pushes ahead with its plans to boost production of new energy vehicles.The move comes as automakers race to develop vehicles powered by means other than petrol to meet an expected rise in demand as the world's top car market enforces official production quotas designed to reduce smog.Geometry will take overseas orders but will mainly focus on the Chinese market and will launch more than 10 pure electric models in multiple segments by 2025, Geely said in a statement on Thursday.The company added it had already received more than 26,000 orders globally for its first model, the Geometry A. The longer-range version of the model has an ability to travel up to 500 kilometers (310.69 miles) on a single charge, Geely said. Geely launched Geometry at an event in Singapore and said the city-state would eventually become a target market."The launch of Geometry and its first product advances Geely's strategic goal of becoming one of world top 10 automotive groups," An Conghui, president of Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, said in the statement.Geely set up a new joint venture with Germany's Daimler just last month to build the next generation of Smart electric cars in China. Smart is Daimler's small-car brand.Geely is also developing new energy commercial vehicles like pickup trucks at another unit, Yuan Cheng Auto. China has been a keen supporter of new energy vehicles (NEV) including pure battery electric, hybrid, and plug-in hybrid technologies, and started implementing NEV sales quota requirements for automakers. According to a Reuters report, global automakers are planning a $300 billion surge in spending on electric vehicle technology over the next five to 10 years, with nearly half of the money targeted at China.Geely posted sales growth of 20 percent in 2018. However, it is forecasting largely steady sales this year as the country's giant auto market struggles with slowing economic growth and more cautious consumers. Last year, the overall market contracted for the first time since the 1990s.The Chinese carmaker bought Volvo Cars in 2010 from Ford Motor Co in what was China's biggest acquisition of a foreign car maker at the time.  (Reporting by Yilei Sun and Brenda Goh in Shanghai; Editing by Himani Sarkar)DUBAI/LONDON/MOSCOW — OPEC could raise oil output from July if Venezuelan and Iranian supply drops further and prices keep rallying, because extending production cuts with Russia and other allies could overtighten the market, sources familiar with the matter said.Venezuelan crude production has dropped below 1 million barrels per day (bpd) because of U.S. sanctions. Iranian supply could fall further after May if, as many expect, Washington tightens its sanctions against Tehran.The combined supply cuts have helped to drive a 32 percent rally in crude prices this year to nearly $72 a barrel, prompting pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump for OPEC to ease its market-supporting efforts. OPEC has been saying the curbs must remain, but that stance is now softening."If there was a big drop in supply and oil went up to $85, that's something we don't want to see, so we may have to increase output," one OPEC source said. The market outlook remains unclear and much depends on how far Washington tightens the screw on Iran and Venezuela before OPEC's June meeting, the source added.The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers, an alliance known as OPEC+, are reducing output by 1.2 million bpd from Jan. 1 for six months. They meet on June 25-26 to decide whether to extend the pact.A Russian official indicated this week that Moscow wanted to pump more, in comments that a Russian energy source said were aimed at preparing the market for the end of output curbs.However, President Vladimir Putin seemingly softened that stance.A second OPEC source said producers "might" pump more if output dropped further from Iran and Venezuela and oil went above $80 by June. If this happened, any increase would be smaller than 1.2 million bpd, the source saidA third OPEC source raised the prospect of amending the deal in June while still extending the pact, citing declines in Iranian and Venezuelan production plus volatility in Libyan supply."I expect an extension for a further period, but maybe there will be some adjustment," this source said.In 2018 OPEC+ decided to increase output at its mid-year meeting, only to return to production cuts in 2019.OUTPUT DROPSOutput declines in OPEC because of the supply pact, plus the sanctions on Venezuela and Iran, have exceeded expectations.Venezuela pumped 960,000 bpd in March, down almost 500,000 bpd from February, OPEC said in a report on Wednesday. The report pointed to a slightly under-supplied market in 2019 if OPEC kept pumping at March's level.For a graphic on World oil market balance 2019, see - https://tmsnrt.rs/2VBfVGG The International Energy Agency on Thursday reported an even lower figure for Venezuela's March output and said the country's production is likely to fall further this month. Adding to the impact of the involuntary declines, top exporter Saudi Arabia has cut production by more than it agreed under the global pact.A fourth OPEC source said there were talks about ideas such as whether OPEC should continue with the cuts alone, a deal extension of only three months to keep Russia on board or pumping more if prices rise further."An increase is on the table, yes, if prices went to $80 and higher," this OPEC source said. "It all depends on where prices are by the end of May and June."Saudi Arabia can add more oil to the market without adjusting production quotas since the kingdom's output in March was some 500,000 bpd below its OPEC target, the source added.Russia is also ready to boost supplies. "Russia has started talks about an oil production rise as it can hardly follow the OPEC+ deal," said another Russian energy source. "The companies are struggling to curb production."

The FCA could reciprocate with a ban on trading UK and even some liquid EU shares outside the United Kingdom.The FCA declined to comment.Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May is asking EU leaders on Wednesday for a further delay to Brexit until at least the end of June, and Raspiller said uncertainty over Brexit was damaging for market participants.

At the high end of that range, the digital pin board company would be valued at about $11.3 billion, accounting for stock options and restricted stock. The business was first valued at $12 billion in 2015, and again in 2017, by venture capitalists and other private investors.Pinterest’s price range dampens some of the fervor over a wave of tech offerings this year, which had promised to generate piles of new wealth in Silicon Valley. It follows last month’s I.P.O. of Lyft, the ride-hailing company, which is deeply unprofitable. While the offering created a great deal of hype and Lyft’s shares rose on their first day of trading, the stock fell below its offering price on its second day of trading, as it faced questions about its business.“People are looking at Lyft and realizing that even if the road show goes extremely well and there is a lot of demand, you can’t overprice the offering,” said Elliot Lutzker, corporate and securities partner at Davidoff Hutcher & Citron.He added that investors were looking more at business fundamentals. “Not every company is an Amazon that can afford to lose money for years and years while growing,” he said.How Lyft and Pinterest perform in their public debuts will be critical in the lead-up to the public offering of Uber, the largest of this generation of tech start-ups. Uber is expected to go public in the next few months at a valuation of around $120 billion, in what would be the biggest I.P.O. by an American company.Several other smaller companies are also planning public offerings, including Zoom, a video conferencing company; PagerDuty, a software company; and Slack, an office communications company.Pinterest’s filing on Monday coincided with the beginning of the company’s so-called road show, during which it plans to pitch institutional investors before the company’s final I.P.O. pricing and first day of trading. High demand from investors over the next several days could lead the company to raise the price of its shares.At the midpoint of its price range, the company would raise around $1.2 billion from public market investors. Pinterest also has $628 million in cash on its balance sheet.If Pinterest goes public below its last private market valuation, that will not be a first for this generation of highly valued start-ups. Box, a cloud storage company, went public in 2015 at $1.6 billion, below its $2.4 billion private market valuation. The company now trades at a $2.8 billion market capitalization. Square, a payments company that was worth $6 billion in the private market, went public in 2015 at a $2.9 billion valuation. Square now has a $31 billion market capitalization.In total, private investors have poured about $1.5 billion into Pinterest. A market debut below $12 billion could spell a loss for the ones that invested most recently.But the company’s earlier investors will still see huge paydays. In its updated prospectus, Pinterest revealed the ownership stakes of its biggest shareholders, which include the venture capital firms Bessemer Venture Partners, FirstMark Capital and Andreessen Horowitz. At the midpoint of the proposed I.P.O. price range, Bessemer’s stake would be worth $952 million, FirstMark’s would be worth $710 million, and Andreessen’s would be $696 million.The biggest individual shareholder is Ben Silbermann, Pinterest’s 36-year-old chief executive and co-founder. He owns 11.4 percent of Pinterest’s shares, making his stake worth $825 million at the midpoint of the pricing range. Evan Sharp, 36, another co-founder and the chief design and creative officer, owns 2.1 percent of the company.Pinterest, which makes digital pin boards that allow people to save images and links from around the web, took off around 2011. Pinners, as users are known, create collagelike mood boards on topics like food, events and hobbies. Mr. Silbermann, who has taken a conservative approach to spending and growth, sought to build the company slowly. In 2014, Pinterest began selling ads.Mr. Silbermann’s methods contrasted with those of other entrepreneurs who lead companies known as unicorns, which are valued at more than $1 billion by private investors. Such companies have typically put a priority on fast growth over profits and take many years to go public. Unicorns that sell or go public below their last private valuation are known as undercorns.Like its peers, Pinterest loses money. But the company, which generates revenue from advertising, is burning less cash than Lyft or Uber. Last month, Pinterest revealed it lost $63 million on revenue of $756 million in 2018. Pinterest is also growing quickly, reporting a 60 percent jump in revenue from 2017 to 2018.The company plans to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol PINS.NEW YORK — Optimism that the United States and China will soon reach a trade deal has helped propel stocks close to new highs, but the decisive factor in whether the bull market runs much further may be this year's corporate earnings.Earnings season begins in earnest on Friday when JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co report quarterly results. Profit forecasts have been falling, and beating these lowered expectations could provide a catalyst for sustaining the rally that began a decade ago, investors say.The S&P 500 has risen 14.8% so far this year and is now just 1.8% below its record closing high of 2,930.75 on Sept. 20 and even closer to the 2,900 median year-end forecast from market strategists polled by Reuters in February.Rising expectations that a U.S.-China trade agreement is imminent have driven much of this year's gain in stocks, a reversal of the sharp sell-off in the fourth quarter of 2018. The Federal Reserve's move to pause interest-rate hikes has also helped fuel the run-up, outweighing concerns that the global economy is slowing.Yet those factors may not be enough to sustain the bull run if corporate earnings are underwhelming. Risks remain on trade too, with U.S. trade official Clete Willems telling Reuters on Monday that the White House is "not satisfied yet" about all the issues standing in the way of a deal to end the U.S.-China trade war. While earnings are expected to fall 2.5% year-over-year in the first quarter and register tepid growth in the second and third quarters, according to Refinitiv, consensus estimates have them rebounding in the fourth quarter, rising 8.9%."Whatever trade deal may come to fruition may cause a small short-term spike in markets, but it's largely priced in," said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York. "Corporate earnings and economic data are much more critical."Especially worrying for investors is the potential of a corporate earnings recession, defined as at least two quarters of falling year-over-year profits, in 2019. First-quarter earnings are already projected to fall from 2018 figures, and further downward revisions to second-quarter estimates, currently at 2.5% year-over-year growth, could put them in negative territory as well."Almost all the earnings growth is backloaded into the end of the year," said Emily Roland, head of capital markets research at John Hancock Investments in Boston. "We're going to need a positive surprise in earnings to keep the engine running for strong market returns."Some believe that with lowered expectations, companies have ample room to surprise to the upside in their quarterly reports. Even if first-quarter profits decline, upbeat outlooks for the rest of the year could lift stocks.Earnings estimates do not reflect the positive effect of lower interest rates, said John Carey, portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston. Lower rates also bode well for consumer confidence, Carey said."With a more benign interest-rate outlook, we could go back to more positive earnings projections," he said. "It's a fairly major development."TRADE DEAL COULD PLAY ROLE IN EARNINGSWhile many investors believe a U.S. trade agreement with China would provide only a limited boost to equities at this point, the effects of such a deal could play a significant role in earnings outlooks for the second half of the year.Investors have sought to pinpoint how much of a slowdown in China's economic growth can be attributed to the effect of U.S. tariffs. If China's economy continues to slow even after a trade deal is reached, that malaise could inflame global economic fears once again, said Shannon Saccocia, chief investment officer at Boston Private. That could trigger a flight away from shares of U.S. multinationals with high China exposure, similar to what occurred in the spring of 2018.But several market watchers expect a rebound in Chinese economic growth as the country's stimulus measures take root and trade pressures are alleviated.Such a recovery would bode well for U.S. corporate earnings, particularly in the technology sector. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, for instance, has risen 26.8% this year on the expectation that demand for chips will rebound as China's pace of economic growth is restored."If earnings growth firms up a little bit, that can drive the market higher," said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at D.A. Davidson in Seattle. "If we have a good U.S. economy and get China stimulus, you could make the argument that the environment for corporate earnings is positive."

E.T.F.s also offer some tax advantages compared with mutual funds, said Larry Stein, a certified financial planner who manages more than $30 million at his Disciplined Investment Management firm in Deerfield, Ill.“All of my investments are in very basic traditional E.T.F.s,” Mr. Stein said. “It gives me the greatest diversification at the lowest possible cost.”A fee price war is underway. In a February filing, for example, the Vanguard Group said it was reducing fees on 10 funds with combined assets of $176 billion. Then SoFi, an online lender, said it planned to offer zero-fee E.T.F.s, while Charles Schwab and Fidelity increased the numbers of E.T.F.s. that could be traded without commissions. State Street Global Advisors, Defiance, BlackRock and DWS also announced that they were starting new low-fee funds, while JPMorgan Chase cut the fees on one of its United States stock funds to 0.02 percent.By the end of 2018, XTF, a fund analysis firm, found that nearly three-quarters of all assets in E.T.F.s were held in funds with expense ratios of less than 0.2 percent — just $2 for every $1,000 invested.Low-cost index mutual funds have been gaining popularity, too.In September, Fidelity introduced two index mutual funds with zero expense ratios, even lower than Vanguard’s cheapest index fund, the 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares, which has a ratio of 0.04 percent. The Fidelity funds — the Zero Total Market Index Fund and Zero International Index Fund — took in $1 billion in their first month. In March, BlackRock announced that it would cut fees on its iShares S&P 500 Index Fund to $1.25 for every $10,000 invested from $4, making it BlackRock’s cheapest fund.The failure of most active investment managers to match — much less beat — major indexes such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Index has created a strong argument for cheap index funds that simply mimic those benchmarks.“More investors are appreciating the virtues of index investing, and more investors are appreciating the value of low cost — the less you pay for your investments, the more you have in your account,” said Rich Powers, who heads E.T.F. management at Vanguard.With just a few E.T.F.s, an investor can build a broadly diversified portfolio in domestic and foreign stocks and bonds.The Bogleheads, a group of admirers of John C. Bogle — the founder of the Vanguard Group and the godfather of low-cost investing — often recommend a simple, three-fund portfolio that tracks the total United States stock market, international stock markets and the domestic investment-grade bond market. Through 2018, such a portfolio, with 60 percent allocated to stocks and 40 percent to bonds, returned 8.2 percent, annualized over 10 years and 5.57 percent over 20 years.Warren E. Buffett has recommended an even simpler approach for most investors: a two-fund strategy, split between short-term government bonds and a low-cost Standard & Poor’s 500 index fund. He said he thinks the “long-term results from this policy will be superior to those attained by most investors.”The explosion of cheap funds has created some dangerous temptations for investors, however. For one thing, the ability to buy and sell E.T.F.s just like stocks can encourage too much daily trading, with associated expenses that eat into returns. Some funds are narrow in focus and not suitable for all portfolios. Simply because a fund is cheap does not mean that it’s a wise investment.Investors should look beyond low expense ratios to the spread in bid and ask prices offered by buyers and sellers. Smaller or more thinly traded E.T.F.s can bear wider spreads that defeat low fees, while bigger, more popular funds tracking common indexes can offer lower total costs.“Broadly diversified E.T.F.s usually trade in a tight spread,” said Mr. Powers of Vanguard. “We always encourage investors to look at the spread, especially when they’re comparing these very low-cost funds.”Another caveat is that a portfolio of basic E.T.F.s or index mutual funds will rise and fall with the broad market. That’s great when markets are rising. But investors who’ve used only index funds during this decade-long bull market could be in for a surprise when a real bear market emerges.If you are likely to need money soon to live on, for example, you will want to make sure you have managed the risk of your portfolio carefully, Mr. Stein of Disciplined Investment management said.“But for young people who don’t need to manage risk, E.T.F.s are an incredible thing,” he added. If all goes as expected and you are truly invested for the long term, he said, there is a good chance that you can “close your eyes and look at it 30 years later and you’re going to be very happy.”TOKYO — Japanese banks have stepped up investments in highly illiquid, securitised loans, mostly in the U.S. market, as it becomes increasingly difficult to earn decent interest income from conventional products like government bonds.A Reuters survey showed some of Japan's biggest banks, led by Norinchukin Bank, have nearly doubled their investment in collateralised loan obligations (CLOs) in the nine months to December.While the increased exposure brings back memories of similar, complex products made up of subprime mortgages that triggered a global financial crisis a decade ago, banks say they are managing risks carefully.Moreover, analysts expect institutions to continue buying such assets as Japanese investors seek returns amid a zero interest rate environment at home and a shrinking pool of stable, high yield income abroad. "We are controlling risks and returns from our major asset classes -- bonds, stocks and credit products -- by looking at their correlations and with proper checks by our risk control desk," said a spokesman for the Norinchukin Bank, by far the biggest CLO buyer among Japanese banks.CLOs are essentially an investment in a pool of loans to high-risk, low-credit companies. But not all investors share the same return and risk.Those who invest in the "equity" part, typically up to 10 percent of the entire pool, enjoy very high yields but have to take losses from borrowers default first.When defaults increase more than the equity investors can absorb, investors in "junior" tranches are next in line to suffer losses, followed by "mezzanine" tranche holders.The rest, typically about 60-70 percent of the total pool, are called "senior" tranches and normally come with AAA credit ratings because their repayments are at risk only when the other three classes fail to cover losses.That means they suffer losses only when more than 30-40 percent of loans default, an unlikely scenario even under a severe economic downturn, at least based on historical records.All the Japanese banks Reuters contacted said they have bought only AAA tranches.Senior CLOs are attractive because they typically yield about 100 basis points or more above U.S. Treasuries despite their high credit ratings.The hefty yield spread is the premium issuers need to pay investors for holding illiquid assets."As long as we can earn appropriate spreads, we plan to deal with CLO issues that will be resilient to risks," said spokesman at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings.The size of securitised debt market shrank after the crisis. In the United States, it fell from over $1 trillion to around $600 billion in 2013. But since then it has gradually recovered to around $800 billion (£613 billion).Market players say CLOs today are considered less risky than the notorious collateralised debt obligations, or CDOs, which caused a massive market shock in 2007-08 after subprime borrowers' default jumped.Regulations have become tighter since then and borrowers in CLOs are companies, whose financial records are easier to analyse for investors, rather than thousands of subprime mortgage borrowers.Still, analysts say they cannot rule out the possibility that CLO prices would fall if an unexpected economic downturn prompted investor panic."When the economy deteriorates, we could have a vicious cycle of rising funding costs increasing defaults further," said Yukichi Shimosato, market analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities. "And because the CLO market is illiquid, if investors pull out some money, the price of CLOs could fall to extreme levels."Graphic: Japanese banks' holding of CLOs (https://tmsnrt.rs/2X2y2pp) (Additional reporting and writing by Hideyuki Sano; Editing by Sam Holmes)(Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc has decided it will seek to sell around $10 billion worth of stock in its initial public offering, and will make public the registration of the offering on Thursday, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.An IPO of this size would make Uber one of the biggest technology IPOs of all time, and the largest since that of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd in 2014.Uber is seeking a valuation of between $90 billion and $100 billion, influenced by the poor performance of smaller rival Lyft Inc's shares following its IPO late last month, the sources said. Investment bankers previously told Uber it could be worth as much as $120 billion.Uber most recently was valued at $76 billion in the private fundraising market.Most of the shares sold would be issued by the company, while a smaller portion would be owned by Uber investors cashing out, one of the sources said. Uber plans to make its IPO registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission publicly available on Thursday, and will kick of its investor roadshow during the week of April 29, putting it on track to price its IPO and begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange in early May, the sources said. The sources cautioned that the plans are still subject to change and market conditions, and asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.A representative for Uber declined to comment. Lyft's IPO priced at the top end of its upwardly revised range last month, assigning it a valuation of more than $24 billion in an offering that raised $2.34 billion. But the stock has traded poorly since debuting on the Nasdaq on March 29, as concerns about the startup's path to profitability have become more prominent. The shares ended trading on Tuesday at $67.44, well below their $72 IPO price.In moderating its valuation expectations, Uber is showing a realism that is being increasingly adopted by Silicon Valley unicorns, as stock market investors push back against some of the lofty price tags sought.On Monday, Pinterest Inc set a price range for its IPO that values it below the $12 billion at which the online image-search company sourced its last private fundraising in 2017.Uber operates in more than 70 countries. In addition to ride-hailing, its business includes bike and scooter rentals, freight hauling, food delivery, and an expensive self-driving car division. During the IPO roadshow, Uber's chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, will be tasked with convincing investors that he has successfully changed the company’s culture and business practices after a series of embarrassing scandals over the last two years.Those have included sexual harassment allegations, a massive data breach that was concealed from regulators, use of illicit software to evade authorities and allegations of bribery overseas.Uber last year had revenue of $11.3 billion, while gross bookings from rides was $50 billion. But the company lost $3.3 billion, excluding gains from the sale of its overseas business units in Russia and Southeast Asia.

Baker in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler)ST PETERSBURG, Russia — President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday that Russia and OPEC should discuss the future of their oil output-cutting deal later this year, adding that current oil prices suited Moscow.The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other large oil producers led by Russia agreed to reduce their combined output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from Jan. 1 this year for six months in an attempt to balance the market.Russia undertook to cut its production by 228,000 bpd but has struggled to comply with the pact. On Monday, one of the key Russian officials to foster the pact with OPEC, Kirill Dmitriev, signalled that Russia wanted to raise oil output when it meets with OPEC in June because of improving market conditions and falling stockpiles.But Putin, the ultimate decision-maker in Russia, seemingly softened that stance, saying it was too early to judge whether the deal should be extended."We are ready for cooperation with OPEC in decision-making ... But whether it would be cuts, or just a stoppage at the current level of output, I am not ready to say," Putin told an Arctic conference in St. Petersburg."We are not supporters of uncontrollable price rises," he said. Putin also said current oil prices suited Russia, which is heavily dependent on sales of oil and natural gas.OPEC and allied oil producers are due to meet in late June in Vienna."Of course, we and our partners ... are closely watching the market. We agreed that if there is a need for joint efforts, we will gather in the second half of the year and hold discussions," Putin said.Putin also said Russian companies had their own plans and their intention to develop new fields should be taken into account. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said earlier on Tuesday there would be no need to extend the output deal if the oil market was expected to be balanced in the second half of the year, the RIA news agency reported.Novak later said all options were on the table.

During the IPO roadshow, Uber's chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, will be tasked with convincing investors that he has successfully changed the company’s culture and business practices after a series of embarrassing scandals over the last two years.Those have included sexual harassment allegations, a massive data breach that was concealed from regulators, use of illicit software to evade authorities and allegations of bribery overseas.Uber last year had revenue of $11.3 billion, while gross bookings from rides was $50 billion. But the company lost $3.3 billion, excluding gains from the sale of its overseas business units in Russia and Southeast Asia.

Without a deal, it would no longer be coupled to European power markets and the UK market would be split between the EPEX SPOT and Nord Pool hubs.It would mean there were two day-ahead power prices for Britain for the same delivery period."Although there is no legal requirement obliging power exchanges to maintain a single UK price, we call on EPEX SPOT and Nord Pool to find practical arrangements to re-establish a single price for the UK bidding zone," EFET said in a statement."Maintaining a single reference price is crucial for ensuring the efficient functioning of the wholesale market in power inside Britain, in particular with regard to price discovery and efficient hedging," it added.EPEX SPOT said it has been discussing arrangements for maintaining a single UK power price after Brexit with parties in Britain and Europe over the past few weeks."So far, unfortunately, we have not obtained the necessary alignment of all concerned parties on a pragmatic solution, but we will continue to push for it," it added.Nord Pool said it has been in discussions with the British government and energy market regulator for many months about the issue, adding it had yet to be satisfactorily addressed.A spokeswoman for the company said talks with UK stakeholders were continuing and its top priority was to ensure its members could continue to trade with confidence on its platform in the event of a hard Brexit. British Prime Minister Theresa May will meet German leader Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday to argue for a Brexit delay as her ministers continue to hold crisis talks with the opposition Labour Party to try to break the deadlock in London.As it stands, Britain will leave the EU at 2200 GMT on Friday.

Without those two countries, the European buyers would have dragged the market much lower," one seller said.A projected rise in buying from European refineries, which supply fuel to the United States, is offering some support for now. Light Nigerian oil is easily processed into higher octane gasoline increasingly used in the United States, where the summer driving season looms.As a result, sellers of Bonny Light and Qua Iboe crude are offering at and above a premium of $2.00 a barrel compared to dated Brent, the benchmark North Sea crude.Graphic: Nigerian crude offered near five-year highs (https://tmsnrt.rs/2I0p4p0)But European refiners are also driving a hard bargain, balking at higher Nigerian prices when one trader said the market was flooded by "a sea of cheap U.S. oil.""We have many options that mean Nigerian won't work for us at these prices," another trader said, adding that in addition to U.S. oil, European refiners could turn to North Sea and Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) crudes.CPC oil "costs us 50 cents less a barrel compared to the prices being asked for Nigerian, given the freight costs and market structure," he said.Sellers of Nigerian crude are still learning to live with the surge in U.S. shale output, which has turned the United States into the world's top crude producer and dampened demand for imports in what had been a reliable market for Nigeria."Nigerian crude has taken a beating for the last 10 years ever since the U.S. scaled back buying," the seller added.Nigerian exports of crude and petroleum products to the United States plunged from 36.4 million barrels in July 2010 to just 5.6 million barrels in January 2019, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Graphic: U.S. Imports of Nigerian Crude (https://tmsnrt.rs/2Vnk1SA)After Washington lifted a four-decade ban on exports of U.S. oil in 2015, shipments to Europe hit an all-time high of 25 million barrels in March 2019 from just 2 million barrels in February 2016, Refinitiv Eikon data showed.This has put a squeeze on a prime Nigerian market.U.S. oil is also heading to India, where it is increasingly competing with Nigerian crude. Indian Oil Corp, the country's top refiner, signed its first annual deal to buy U.S. oil in February, paying about $1.5 billion for 60,000 barrels a day up to March 2020.Despite the pressure from U.S. barrels, Nigerian exports to Europe, India and Indonesia have held generally steady so far.Consistent tenders from state buyers in India and Indonesia ensure these remain major destinations for Nigerian oil.But one Asian buyer said Indian tenders were largely finished for the month, and that Nigerian cargoes for April and May would soon need to find buyers in Europe instead."Nigerian is facing stiff competition almost everywhere," a trading source said. "Sooner or later Nigerian oil is going to need to expand into new markets."

Those projects end later this year.Foreign insurers would compete with eight established Chinese pension insurance firms that dominate the potentially lucrative market, where the fast-greying population is set to produce 250 million people older than 60 by 2020."The average longevity of people in China is increasing but the pension market remains under-penetrated," Prudential Asia Chief Executive Nic Nicandrou told Reuters.Some of the foreign companies are expected to submit applications in the second half of this year to set up pensions businesses, the people said. They declined to be identified as the plans are not firm yet and also are not public."POISED"Last month, Heng An Standard Life, a joint venture between Standard Life Aberdeen and Tianjin TEDA International, became the first foreign joint-venture entity to receive regulatory approval by China to establish a pensions insurance company.China's pensions assets, including those managed by the state, grew by 20 percent in 2017 to 11 trillion yuan (£1.26 trillion) and are expected to more than quadruple by 2025, consultancy KPMG said in a report this year.Underlining the potential, consultant Willis Towers Watson said China has one of the lowest ratios of private-employee annuity pension assets to GDP among major economies at 1.5 percent. That compares with 120.5 percent of GDP in the United States and more than 130 percent in Australia.Prudential has a 50-50 life-insurance venture with China's CITIC Group. Nicandrou said the venture is "well poised" to participate in the pension market but he did not elaborate on any specific plans.Rob Leonardi, Asia regional officer for Italy's top insurer Generali, said the firm was seeing progress in pensions reform in China."If this trend continues, we can expect more foreign funded companies to express further interest in the coming months," he said. The company declined to give details about its plans for the market.AIA, which operates the only wholly owned foreign life insurance business in China, declined to comment."MATTER OF TIME"Global asset managers have been lobbying Beijing to offer tax benefits and other incentives to encourage investment in mutual funds for retirement.Manulife, which signed a pact with Agricultural Bank of China in 2017 to jointly explore opportunities in China's pension and retirement market, is looking to establish a joint-venture pension management company.It plans to draw upon its life insurance and asset management joint ventures in China to launch retirement solutions and products, said Calvin Chiu, head of Asia retirement at Manulife Asset Management."The government has expressed willingness to open up the financial services sectors in the country, it's just a matter of time and priority. They do recognise the value that foreign players can add in the pension space," he said.China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission and the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security did not respond to Reuters requests for comment."All countries are trying to shift pensions away from the iron rice bowl concept," Gerry Grimstone, chairman of Heng An Standard Life said."There have been some attempts at this in China, but, the fact is, there is technology in the west, and an approach to this which the Chinese were keen to bring into their market." (Reporting by Sumeet Chatterjee and Alun John; Editing by Neil Fullick)(Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc's initial public offering (IPO) filing on Thursday will draw inevitable comparisons to its smaller ride-hailing rival Lyft Inc, which completed its initial public listing last month.Following Lyft's poor stock market performance of late, investors will be scrutinizing Uber's financial results and projections closely.Not only is Uber much larger than Lyft, but it is also more complex, with operations that go beyond its core ride-hailing business and extend into areas such as food delivery and freight transit. The following are four key financial metrics which investors will be watching for: REVENUEUber is a much larger company than Lyft, with operations in markets ranging from the United States to Latin America to North Africa. Lyft operates entirely in North America.Uber also has a broader array of business lines, including a food delivery service and a platform for commercial freight. As a result, Uber clocks much higher revenues than Lyft. Uber reported net revenues of $11.4 billion in 2018. That is in comparison to $2.2 billion for Lyft during the same year. If one considers revenue growth, however, Uber may take a back seat to Lyft. Lyft has been rapidly gaining market share relative to its larger rival, meaning that its revenue growth has been outpacing Uber's. Lyft's revenue more than doubled between 2017 and 2018, from just over $1 billion to more than $2.1 billion. Uber's, meanwhile, grew 43 percent, to $11.4 billion. ADJUSTED EBITDAThis common measure of profitability will look similar to Lyft's in one major respect: both Uber and Lyft are loss-making companies. Uber reported an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) loss of $1.8 billion in 2018, compared to around $950 million for Lyft. But expect Uber to argue to investors that its scale will give it a significant advantage in terms of profitability over the long run, allowing it to more effectively hold down costs. It will also likely point out that its year-over-year losses are down, from $2.2 billion in 2017. Lyft's ticked up over the same timeframe. CONTRIBUTION MARGINThis lesser-known financial metric will likely play a big role in Uber's pitch to investors. It is designed to show whether Uber's operations in individual markets are profitable on a standalone basis by ignoring company-wide costs like marketing or technology investment. Expect Uber to make a case that positive contribution margins in many of its markets mean that, fundamentally, its business model works. Uber has a different method of calculating contribution margin than Lyft, so the two companies' figures cannot be directly compared, a person familiar with the matter said.MONTHLY ACTIVE USERSUber generates more rides than Lyft in large part due to its wider, global presence. Lyft had 18.6 million monthly active riders as of the fourth quarter of 2018.  (Reporting by Carl O'Donnell in New York, editing by G Crosse)WASHINGTON — Risks to the global financial system have grown over the past six months and could increase with a messy British exit from the European Union or an escalation of U.S.-China trade tensions, the International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday.The IMF, whose spring meetings with the World Bank begin in Washington this week, noted that the global economic expansion is slowing, and an abrupt downturn could have a far-reaching impact. "After years of economic expansion, global growth is slowing, sparking concerns about a deeper downturn," Tobias Adrian, head of the IMF's monetary and capital markets department, said at a briefing to discuss the international lender's Global Financial Stability Report. The IMF warned against rolling back prudential regulations that could help to buffer the financial system in the event of a downturn."There is a risk that positive investor sentiment could deteriorate abruptly, leading to a sharp tightening of financial conditions," the IMF said in its report. "This will have a larger effect on economies with weaker fundamentals, greater financial vulnerabilities, and less policy space to respond to shocks."On Tuesday, the IMF cut its expectations for global growth to its lowest level since 2016, its third downgrade since October. In Wednesday's report, it cautioned a sharper-than-expected slowdown could spur tighter financial conditions.In Wednesday's report, the IMF urged policymakers to clearly communicate any changes to their monetary policy stances to minimize market swings. Noting investor sentiment had improved since the U.S. Federal Reserve paused its rate-hiking cycle, it warned that a strong shift in Fed policy could trigger a sell-off in riskier assets.CORPORATE DEBT CONCERNSThe IMF also echoed concerns raised by U.S. officials over rising corporate debt levels, saying that corporate sector risks appear elevated in about 70 percent of systematically important countries.A rapid tightening of financial conditions could drive a steep economic downturn, as creditworthiness in the corporate debt market has deteriorated. The stock of lower-rated investment-grade bonds has quadrupled since the 2008 financial crisis, and the stock of speculative-grade credits has nearly doubled. "The U.S. corporate credit cycle appears to be at its highest point in recent history," the IMF said, adding that global earnings growth has "likely peaked."The IMF noted that trading in British and European markets has remained orderly as authorities struggle to negotiate an orderly British exit deal.However, it warned that a protracted stalemate threatens to "unsettle financial markets, damage investors’ confidence, (and) adversely affect business investment."Globally, trade-dependent sectors have risen on expectations of a positive outcome for U.S.-China trade talks, the IMF said, but if those talks falter the organisation expects a renewed sell-off.To guard against financial vulnerabilities, the IMF said policymakers should proactively deploy prudential tools, such as the countercyclical capital buffer and bank stress testing. In particular, regulators should develop tools to tackle climbing corporate debt from non-bank intermediaries. "A rollback of regulatory reforms should be avoided," it added.

The world's second-biggest clothing retailer, whose core H&M chain accounts for the bulk of group sales, is investing heavily in adapting to rapidly changing consumer habits after seeing profits fall and inventories pile up in recent years.A new version of the customer loyalty scheme separates members into a "base" tier or a "plus" tier depending on how many points they earned in the past year, according to Samuel Holst, head of the fast-growing H&M Club. It means base members in Germany, the Swedish group’s biggest market, will need to spend at least 25 euros ($28) to get free delivery. In its home market, the minimum outlay is 200 Swedish crowns ($22). "We have a lot of logistics around the customers that shop online," Holst told Reuters in an interview at H&M's headquarters. "For the plus level, deliveries will remain free for all purchases, but for the base level there will be a cap, " he said. "You will need to shop for a certain amount to get free delivery. Returns remain free for all. "Holst declined to say how much H&M expects to save from the move. The company has an H&M Club in 16 of the H&M brand's 71 markets. It plans to add seven more markets, including the United States, by the end of the year. The number of members doubled in 2018 to 30 million, helped by the introduction of free deliveries and returns for all members. Another 5 million joined in the first quarter of 2019. "We want to keep up the growth pace we've had so far, and increase it this year," Holst said. Members earn points through reviews and rating purchases, and otherwise interacting with H&M in the app, as well as on purchases, he said. H&M's move to rein in free deliveries for scheme members comes after German online clothing marketplace Zalando recently introduced a minimum order threshold in Italy to increase orders.  (Reporting by Anna Ringstrom; Editing by Mark Potter)Uber gave the first sign of how big its highly anticipated initial public offering might be, telling some investors that its stock sale might value it at up to $100 billion, people briefed on the matter said.The number, which is below a $120 billion valuation that had been floated by investment bankers, highlights the size of the ride-hailing colossus as it prepares to embark on its market debut, the biggest in recent years. Its shares are expected to begin trading on the public markets next month.The revelation follows the I.P.O. last month of Uber’s main North American competitor, Lyft, whose shares have since dropped more than 15 percent from their offering price. Another Silicon Valley darling, the digital pin board Pinterest, this week set pricing expectations for its own market debut below its last private fund-raising round.The moves raise questions about investor appetite for prominent but unprofitable technology companies, with a slew of them — including the messaging company Slack and the home fitness company Peloton — also aiming to list their shares this year.“It’s the Lyft effect,” said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital who manages an I.P.O. fund. “This is what Uber should try very hard to avoid — it should not have a stock that breaks its I.P.O. price.”Uber’s potential $100 billion valuation was earlier reported by Reuters and The Wall Street Journal.Uber is expected to publish its public offering prospectus on Thursday, giving investors a closer look into its businesses. That document will not provide any information on the offering’s potential price, but the company recently disclosed its latest thinking about its own valuation to some investors.In a notice to holders of some of its convertible bonds last week, Uber said that its stock could be valued at $48 to $55 a share, said the people briefed on the situation, who asked not to be identified because the details were confidential. That would translate into a valuation of about $90 billion to $100 billion for the company, factoring in the roughly $10 billion that it expects to raise.The people briefed on the matter cautioned that the I.P.O. process was continuing and that it was too early to determine what Uber’s valuation would ultimately be. The company’s underwriters, led by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, could still raise the price of the shares — and therefore its valuation — in the coming weeks if there is enough interest from prospective shareholders.Even at $90 billion to $100 billion, Uber would be valued well above the $76 billion it was appraised at in its most recent fund-raising in August. Investment bankers last year reckoned the company could fetch a valuation of as much as $120 billion in the public markets.At $90 billion to $100 billion, Uber would be one of the largest American tech companies to go public in recent years. Its debut would be rivaled only by Facebook, which went public at $104 billion in 2012. Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, was the largest initial offering, at $168 billion in 2014. Lyft, by contrast, has a market capitalization of about $17 billion.In recent weeks, brokers who sell shares on behalf of employees and early investors have offered Uber stock to buyers at the $80 billion to $100 billion valuation range, according to two people familiar with them. These sales, on what is known as the secondary market, mean sellers can lock in their returns without waiting for the I.P.O. lockup period to end, while avoiding uncertainty about how the stock will trade. In 2017, some of Uber’s early investors and employees sold portions of their stock to SoftBank as part of the Japanese conglomerate’s $7 billion investment in the company.Although Uber’s debut is hotly anticipated, the company remains unprofitable. The ride-hailing service has released some of its quarterly earnings figures publicly, even though it was not obligated to do so as a private company. In February, Uber said it lost $842 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 on revenue of $3 billion.How the company will get to a point where it makes more money than it loses is likely to be a key question when Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber’s chief executive, meets with investors to sell shares in the coming weeks. Mr. Khosrowshahi has pulled back from some markets where Uber was losing money, such as Southeast Asia. But he is also continuing to spend as the company expands into businesses such as food delivery and long-haul trucking.Mr. Khosrowshahi has previously emphasized the importance of Uber’s business being able to generate cash. He has also said that the company does not need to be making money before going public, but that it must be able to show a path to profits.“You need to demonstrate a very clear road to profitability,” Mr. Khosrowshahi said at the Fortune Brainstorm conference in July.LONDON — An estimated $67.4 billion of art was sold worldwide last year, an increase of 6 percent on 2017, according to an influential report released on Friday. Yet growth in the art market remains within a narrow band, the data showed.The total, cited in the annual Art Basel and UBS report, combined auction and dealer sales and was the second-highest in the last 10 years, behind the $68.2 billion of 2014.But the report noted that while the number of wealthy individuals in the world had risen sharply, they were not spending much more on art.The study quoted data from Credit Suisse estimating that the global population of dollar millionaires increased to 42.2 million last year, from 29.7 million in 2011. That does not seem to have translated into art buying, however. In 2011, global art sales were estimated at $64.6 billion, just a small fraction below what Art Basel and UBS calculated they were in 2018.“The art world seems to have a conversion problem,” said Doug Woodham, managing partner at Art Fiduciary Advisors in New York. “For some time now, spending in the global art market has significantly lagged growth.”The United States was the largest market, with 44 percent of the world’s art transactions by value, totaling $29.9 billion, its highest level in a decade, according to the report. Britain climbed to second place, with 21 percent of sales (“despite Brexit worries,” the report notes). China dropped from second to third, at 19 percent.“While we’ve seen another strong year of aggregate sales, the mood of the market in 2018 was generally less optimistic, as many wider economic and political issues continued to weigh heavily on sentiment,” wrote the report’s author, the art economist Clare McAndrew.The report estimated that in 2018, dealer sales increased 7 percent to an estimated $35.9 billion, or 53 percent of the market. Large-scale gallerists reportedly enjoyed the biggest gains, with sales increasing 17 percent.The Art Basel and UBS report is the only comprehensive overview of a market that Ms. McAndrew characterized as “notoriously opaque.” While data from public auction sales are freely available, dealer transactions remain private and difficult to quantify. The report estimated gallery sales based on an online survey sent to 6,500 dealers worldwide, including more than 500 that participate in Art Basel shows. Over all, 17.5 percent responded. The results indicated that 46 percent of sales by dealers were made at art fairs.Because of the relatively small sample size, some experts have expressed skepticism about the methodology and questioned the reliability of the report’s extrapolated figures.“I find that figure very high,” said Alain Servais, a Belgian collector, referring to the reported sales at art fairs. “It must be based on galleries who do six or seven fairs a year and have specialist teams,” added Mr. Servais, who is a frequent visitor to fairs around the world. He pointed out a recent study by the specialist website Artsy estimating that only 10 to 15 percent of gallery sales took place at fairs.Online sales reached an estimated $6 billion in 2018, up 11 percent year-on-year, according to the Art Basel and UBS report. But that is still less than 10 percent of the market as a whole.Ms. McAndrew, in the conclusion of the Art Basel and UBS report, said that in recent years, buoyancy in the art market had been supported by “a very small fragment of ultrawealthy buyers” whose involvement was at risk of being affected by “exogenous events.” A broader base of buyers lower down the wealth scale had so far been slower to engage in the market, she said.Be it Brexit or other geopolitical volatility, “exogenous events” seemed to be weighing on the minds of both sellers and buyers at this past week’s contemporary art auctions in London. In March 2018, Sotheby’s, Christie’s and Phillips’s evening contemporary sales raised an aggregate total of 344.6 million pounds, or about $478 million. This week, the total was down to £209 million, a decline of about 39 percent. Top quality works were in short supply and bidding was measured.The standout lot of the week — David Hockney’s monumental 1969 double portrait, “Henry Geldzahler and Christopher Scott” — sold at Christie’s on Wednesday, much as estimated, for £37.7 million.“That was a good buy,” said the London dealer Offer Waterman. “It was one of the artist’s three or four greatest pictures.”The price was almost half the $90.3 million achieved for the artist’s 1972 “Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)” in New York in November.On Thursday, Phillips re-offered the 1963 Gerhard Richter painting, “Jet Fighter,” which it owned after a Chinese guarantor had defaulted on its $24 million sale in 2016. This time round, it raised £15.5 million, or about $20.4 million.“The top end of many markets are probably off about 20 percent,” said Josh Baer, founder of the Baer Faxt, an art trade newsletter.The Art Basel and UBS report showed the overall art market growth has been stagnating. If the results in London this week are anything to go by, it might be even be dipping.LONDON — The use of machine-learning has picked up across the financial services industry, although problems such as data quality continue to dog its progress, a study by Refinitiv has found. In a report, Refinitiv, the financial data provider, said more than 90 percent of the organizations it surveyed had either deployed machine-learning in multiple areas of the organization or have made a start in some pockets.Machine-learning refers to the use of algorithms and statistical models in financial markets without using human directions and instead relies on patterns to make choices.While the initial driver of such technologies was the automation of repetitive tasks, the survey found that the top applications were in the areas of risk avoidance, generating trading and investment ideas and analyzing performance.Conducted via 447 telephone interviews of senior executives and data-science practitioners across various financial services firms, the survey also found the quality of data as the primary barrier to machine-learning adoption.Machine-learning has long been the mainstay of deep-pocketed hedge funds, which have combined complex algorithmic strategies with financial data to make big bets on markets. But with the growing use of cloud computing and the constant pressure on banks to reduce costs, machine-learning techniques have seen a greater acceptance among banks."Thanks to parallel computing and cloud computing, we are seeing the playing field being slowly leveled in terms of machine-learning strategies," said Tim Baker, global head of applied innovation at Refinitiv.The survey also found foreign exchange ranked a distant fourth in terms of structured data by asset class with stocks, fixed income and derivatives the top three. Foreign exchange markets with a myriad trading platforms and opaque over-the-counter trading format was a particular problem area for data scientists when it came to applying machine-learning strategies."Standing in the way of machine-learning adoption in the FX market is a potent combination of data science, engineering and technology management problems," said Matthew Hodgson, CEO and founder of Mosaic Smart Data, a data analytics company.  (Reporting by Saikat Chatterjee; Editing by David Evans)WASHINGTON — U.S. job openings dropped to an 11-month low in February and hiring decreased, which could partially explain a sharp slowdown in job growth during that month.Still, the labor market remains a pillar of support for the economy amid signs that activity was easing because of the fading boost from a $1.5 trillion tax cut package and the effects of interest rate increases over the last few years. The economy is also facing headwinds from slowing global growth and the United States' trade war with China."The February job openings data reinforced that the labor market weakened in February but there isn't any cause for concern," said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. Job openings, a measure of labor demand, tumbled by 538,000 to a seasonally adjusted 7.1 million, the Labor Department said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, report on Tuesday. The drop was the biggest since August 2015. The level was the lowest since March 2018.Vacancies in the accommodation and food services industry fell by 103,000 jobs in February. There were 72,000 fewer job openings in the real estate and rental and leasing sector. Job openings in the transportation, warehousing and utilities sector dropped by 66,000.Nonfarm payrolls increased by only 33,000 jobs in February, the fewest since September 2017. The near-stall in job gains was partially blamed on colder weather and also viewed as payback after robust increases in December and January. Job growth picked up in March, with the economy creating 196,000 positions, the government reported last Friday.WORKERS STILL SCARCEThe drop in job openings in February likely does not change the theme of labor shortages in the economy. A survey of small businesses published on Tuesday found that just over a fifth of owners reported difficulties finding qualified workers as their "single most important business problem" in March.According to the survey from the NFIB, 39 percent of small business owners reported job openings they could not fill in March. Thirty-three percent said they had openings for skilled workers and 14 percent have vacancies for unskilled labor.Economists expect monthly job growth to average roughly 150,000 this year, stepping down from 223,000 in 2018. "There are still millions of help wanted signs out there in the country so we hesitate to revise our outlook for the labor market overall," said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. The dive in job openings in February pushed down the vacancies rate to 4.5 percent from 4.8 percent in January. Hiring fell to 5.7 million in February from 5.8 million in the prior month. The decrease in hiring was led by the construction sector, where hiring fell by 73,000. Hiring in the nondurable goods manufacturing industry dropped by 33,000 in February. Hiring by state and local government education departments fell 22,000.The number of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs was little changed at 3.5 million in February, keeping the quits rate at 2.3 percent for a ninth straight month. The quits rate is viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence. The worker reluctance to switch jobs is despite the tight labor market conditions that are steadily driving up wages."This is not as many quits as you would expect in such a tight labor market, when workers are in higher demand," said Nick Bunker, an economist at Indeed Hiring Lab. "Though perhaps this isn't surprising in the short term given that the ratio of unemployed workers to job openings has been rising."Layoffs increased in February, lifting the layoffs rate to 1.2 percent from 1.1 percent in January.

Follow us on Twitter: @nytrealestate.HONG KONG — Marriott International Inc, the world's biggest hotel company with luxury brands such as St. Regis and Ritz-Carlton, says it is committed to all of its brands which give it the breadth to take advantage of fast-growing markets like China.The company was criticized recently by activist investor Jonathan Litt who, according to media reports, has urged Marriott to consider culling its 30 brands to better align itself with competitors such as Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.Marriott's Global Chief Commercial Officer Stephanie Linnartz, however, said the group aimed to keep expanding across all sectors of the market, especially in Asia."We're focused on growing multiple tiers (in Asia Pacific), not just luxury... we're also excited about growing our Courtyard brand in China," Linnartz told Reuters on Thursday. Mid-scale brands like Courtyard are Marriott's fastest-growing segment in Asia Pacific, the company said.Linnartz was speaking to Reuters during a visit to Hong Kong, where the group opened its first St Regis in the city on Wednesday.Last month Marriott announced plans to open more than 1,700 hotels globally as part of its three-year growth strategy. It has more than 300 hotels in China in the pipeline for the next three to five years and plans to have all 30 of its brands operating in the Asia Pacific region eventually, up from 23 at present.The number of brands was one of the group's greatest strengths, Linnartz said."Because you have so much breadth and choice. We see in our data that, last year, half of the people who stayed in W globally, also stayed in Courtyard, why? Because people will stay in one brand for business trip, and they want to go on their romantic vacation with their spouse."The St Regis in Hong Kong is Marriott's 7,000th property globally. The company also plans to bring the JW Marriott Marquis brand to China later this year, and the Tribute Portfolio brand into India. "We need to be careful to bring what brand into what market, not just the country, but the city. You have to really think about the right consumer demand - is that a luxury market or not?" Linnartz said.(This story has been refilled to add dropped name in paragraph 6)  (Reporting by Clare Jim; Editing by Susan Fenton)The latest generation of Silicon Valley start-ups is now sprinting to the public markets, raising hopes among large and small investors eager to invest in these high-profile, fast-growing firms. But the class of 2019 is far different from its predecessors. These companies, including gig economy darlings like Uber and Lyft, are generally older and larger, powered for years by billions of dollars of private money that has reshaped the start-up world.The additional maturity of the companies may curb wild swings — both big gains and big losses — for new investors. But it could also mean that the companies’ fastest phases of growth are behind them. As a result, there is an increased risk that in this wave of tech I.P.O.s, an elite group of investors, like sovereign wealth funds and venture capitalists, will grab a larger share of the winnings compared with new investors.“Individual investors are going to get in too late,” said Jason DeSena Trennert, managing partner at Strategas Research Partners, a markets and economic analysis firm. “They’re going to be the last investors in, and that’s the concern.”[Lyft’s shares soared on Friday when it began trading on public markets.]The change reflects a large-scale shift in the way that American entrepreneurs raise money to build their companies. Instead of quickly turning to the public markets and the scrutiny that comes with that, as Amazon and Google did, they are building huge businesses over the course of many years on the back of private money, and with fewer demands for financial disclosures.Uber, the giant ride-hailing company, has raised more than $20 billion over the last decade. Lyft, its smaller rival, which priced its I.P.O. late Thursday at $72 a share and is expected to start trading on the Nasdaq Friday, raised $4.9 billion over seven years.Many start-ups in earlier waves — back to the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, when Amazon was listed on the Nasdaq — went public just a few years after their founding. Some, like Pets.com, had tiny amounts of revenue, and now exist only in Silicon Valley lore. A combination of policy changes and vast new riches in the tech industry has been changing the equation for start-ups for more than a decade. Mutual funds and hedge funds — the typical investors in a start-up’s I.P.O. — began buying stakes in large private companies as a way to build up larger stakes before the new businesses went public. Other big investors joined in, including large sovereign wealth funds and the outsize SoftBank Vision Fund, creating an even hotter market. Venture capital investments into United States-based companies grew to $99.5 billion in 2018, the highest level since 2000, according to CB Insights, a company that tracks start-ups.Those investments have driven valuations of start-ups to unusual heights. There are now at least 333 so-called unicorns, companies valued at $1 billion or more, according to CB Insights. In 2014 there were around 80.Lyft has a private valuation of more than $11 billion. So does Pinterest, another company in the process of going public. That is roughly the market value that public investors put on the retailer Kohl’s and the online trading firm E-Trade Financial. Uber, the largest of the private companies expected to head for the stock market this year, has a private-market valuation of more than $70 billion. In public markets, that’s roughly the same size as corporate giants such as Goldman Sachs and CVS Health. Matt Murphy, a partner at Menlo Ventures, a leading venture capital firm, said the higher valuations and larger investments correlate with bigger opportunities created by smartphones and cloud computing. “The magnitude of the audiences that can be reached and the monetization per user has grown,” he said. “Their growth potential is much higher than was previously anticipated.”Some industry groups and investors who urge fewer regulations say the emphasis on the private markets is an outgrowth of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the federal law passed in 2002 that tightened accounting rules for public companies after the accounting scandals of the early 2000s. Besides raising disclosure requirements and other changes, the law required top executives to attest to the accuracy of corporate financial statements. Some say those higher costs to guarantee compliance can dissuade smaller companies from going public. Private companies, by comparison, can operate with far less disclosure. They are under no obligation to file quarterly earnings updates or audited annual financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Nor are they required to broadly distribute updates on business developments to the public. Others say the decline in public offerings began before Sarbanes-Oxley passed. They attribute the change to a wave of federal deregulation, which made it easier to raise money and sell companies privately. Lighter antitrust enforcement set off a boom in mergers and acquisitions, allowing smaller firms to sell to bigger companies instead of going public. At the same time, new laws made it easier for private companies to sell securities to qualified investors around the country, bolstering funding from private equity and venture capital.Whatever the driver, the net result has been a clear downturn in the number of public companies in the United States. The number of listed companies has declined by 52 percent since 1997, to a bit more than 3,600 in 2016, according to a working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research published last year. This long-term shrinkage in publicly available shares is a reason that some analysts expect Uber, Lyft and other prominent start-ups to receive a warm response from the institutional investors who typically buy freshly issued shares, even if the potential upside could be smaller. “There’s an element, I think, of pent-up demand here,” said David Ethridge, who advises on public offerings at the consulting firm PwC. “I think people will have a feeling of, I don’t really want to miss out.”Investors have some reason to be skeptical of paying top dollar for newly minted public companies, however. Over the last two years, the value of companies that completed public offerings actually fell by an average of 8 percent, according to a recent research report from Goldman Sachs analysts. Over the same period, the S&P 500 stock index was up about 12 percent. There has been a divergence on Wall Street. As stocks have approached new highs, expectations for company profits have darkened considerably. Now, with corporate America starting to report first-quarter earnings, stock investors will find out if they ought to restrain their enthusiasm. During the first three months of the year, Wall Street analysts slashed their forecasts for S&P 500 companies’ first-quarter earnings by 7.2 percent, according to the data provider FactSet. The forecasts typically fall as the quarter progresses and analysts get a better sense of how the businesses are performing. But the decline during the first quarter was more than double the typical drop, and the largest cut to earnings estimates during a quarter since the start of 2016.The analysts tracked by FactSet now expect companies in the S&P 500 as a whole to report that profits fell 4.2 percent from a year earlier. It’s a reflection of the slowing global economy, rising costs related to tariffs and wages, and the fact that tax cuts last year, which lifted growth substantially, are now baked in.The souring sentiment around corporate profits has been fairly broad. Seven of the S&P 500’s 11 sectors are forecast to report lower earnings.Corporate profits are typically among the most reliable guides to the future direction of the stock market. And yet American stocks are off to their best start in two decades. The S&P 500 is up about 15 percent this year..“The market has perhaps gotten a bit ahead of itself,” said Kurt Spieler, the chief investment officer at First National Bank of Omaha’s wealth management business. “You need earnings growth to resume. If it doesn’t, there’s a risk of a correction.”So why are stocks rallying as earnings expectations tumble? In part, this is simply a reversal of what sent the S&P 500 tumbling about 9 percent in December: hand-wringing about trade, interest rates and slowing global growth.Since then, the Federal Reserve has put further rate increases on hold, and the United States and China have inched closer to a trade deal. It could be that markets will return to the dynamic that drove stocks higher for most of the decade since the financial crisis: lackluster profit growth that is just good enough to keep stocks grinding higher in a low-rate, low-growth environment.But investors are about to hear from executives and take in company forecasts about the future, and those can push stocks higher or lower. “What will matter is what C.E.O.s say on the conference calls,” said J.J. Kinahan, the chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. “How do they see tariffs affecting their business? And what are the implications if negotiations drag on.”DUBAI/LONDON — Saudi Aramco's debut $12 billion bonds booked at best modest gains on Wednesday, their first trading day after some $100 billion in orders, suggesting part of the record-breaking demand was inflated, three banking and investment sources said.Aramco chose to only issue $12 billion of debt, as its focus was to obtain favorable pricing to set a benchmark for its future financing activities.With almost $90 billion in demand left on the table, traders and fund managers expected the bonds to shoot up in value on Wednesday, but their performance was tepid."The price was a bit inflated as there was a lot of excitement and even hubris around this issue and I would imagine that some of the buyers may have flipped it in the market today," said a London-based fund manager who looked at the deal but decided not to invest in it.One trader and a senior banker said that, after realizing the deal would have been oversubscribed, investors boosted their orders to increase their chances to get a piece of the issuance.Aramco's longest-dated tranche, a $3 billion bond due in 2049, gained value in the secondary market, adding more than one cent on the dollar.But some of the shorter-dated bonds were flat or even lower than where they priced on Tuesday, and lower than in pre-sale grey market trading.The tranche with the shortest duration, a $1 billion bond due in 2022, was trading below the reoffer value at which it was sold on Tuesday, the trader said.Speaking on condition of anonymity, he estimated that demand for Aramco's bonds was inflated by 20-30 percent due to the expected oversubscription."We are seeing the truth of how much (of the demand) was fluff," added a fund manager who participated in the deal.EXPENSIVE BUT FAIR?Still, Aramco's issue was widely regarded as successful."Despite the usual padding, (demand) has definitely outstripped previous highs for emerging market borrowers," said Angad Rajpal, head of fixed income at Emirates NBD Asset Management.The 2046 and 2047 Saudi dollar bonds were down almost one cent - their biggest daily decline since early March, according to Tradeweb - suggesting some players switched their exposure from the sovereign to Aramco. Aramco's staggering finances - with core earnings of $224 billion last year and $86 billion in free cash flow at the end of 2018 - allowed it to target a combination of emerging markets and high-grade investors.It started marketing the notes at levels very close to the yields offered by the Saudi government, which owns the company, but ended up offering around 20 basis points less. Some investors expect yields to gradually widen to match the sovereign rate."Aramco priced (the bonds) relatively expensive versus Saudi but quite attractive versus other major developed-market oil companies, and the potential to see 15-20 basis points spread tightening was too small at these levels," said Sergey Dergachev, functional head of EM corporate debt at Union Investment."The price action has been fair."JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, HSBC, Citi, Goldman Sachs and National Commercial Bank were the bonds' bookrunners.A group of 11 more banks including Bank of China, Deutsche Bank and Gulf International Bank worked on the deal as co-managers, a document issued by one of the banks leading the deal showed.Bank fees for the bonds are unlikely to have topped around 1 basis point per bookrunner, said the sources. That would mean just over $1 million per bank."Fees should be minimal for such a giant bond amount and such a famous issuer," said Lam Nguyen at Freeman Consulting. "I would estimate fees around 0.03 percent - 0.06 percent." The sources said the banks' main interest in getting a role in the deal was to cement their relationship with Aramco ahead of future transactions.Its initial public offering (IPO), due in 2021, is expected to generate $100 billion and to boost the Saudi Public Investment Fund - the main vehicle for Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman's plan to diversify the economy away from oil.
