"@kurknielsen @chromesthesia @AnselRichard @AOC Well maybe and maybe I worked my ass off from nothing and now don't want to give my money to them. Or should I say I don't want you, the left, or gov telling me I have to give them my money. Everyone who starts a business is scared and most fail. That is why success pays well."
"@NoemiPOM @DanAdSense @AOC You answered your own question in the question. You are right, You can't pay a wage so low people won't work for it. Simple supply and demand curves. The fact is that there IS a labor fore that will work for those wages and therefore the business is not required to raise wages."
"@NoemiPOM @DanAdSense @AOC You see that is fine! They choose to pay more, they don't have a government bureaucracy telling them to pay more. The reality is that if a competitive like business opened across the street and paid less, all else being equal, your family would go out of business."
"@LKVang64 @KhalidK45752668 @IlhanMN Whatever, if people don't want the jobs then screw them. I can't help anyone who doesn't care about themselves. They can go start their own business and see how it works out for them. I have no tolerance for people who don't want to work and think they deserve a free handout."
"@NoemiPOM @DanAdSense @AOC They get paid what the market will bear, not what they think they are worth. If they can be replaced by someone willing to work for the wage offered, that is what they are worth. Free market. Do you own a business? If you do or did, would you pay people more than you had to?"
"@NoemiPOM @suzuhiggins @DanAdSense @AOC Trudeau Right! LOL oh my that is quite a statement. No, not in any sense of the word. He is a marxist globalist. Your idea that only the right conspires with big business is a fallacy. The left uses them just as much as the right."
"@MaijaMinistries @AOC When you build a business and have lots of money, be as friendly as you wish and give out as much as you want. I think your thoughts will change. This demand that I deserve more just because I am me BS is stupid and selfish. Make yourself worth more and you will get more."
