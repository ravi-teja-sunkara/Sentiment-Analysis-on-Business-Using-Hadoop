"@neelkashkari @StephanieKelton From an accounting perspective the only reason the deficit can exist as a liability is that accountants defer on the insolvency question to economists. If there was an insolvency hard stop, then UST would have to be treated as contra-asset (against tax receivables).  This is key."
"@neelkashkari @StephanieKelton On a cumulative, nominal basis, starting with George Washington's inauguration to today, 100% of principal redemptions and interest have been funded by new debt - $0 ultimately funded by the tax payer. Looking forward there is not one CBO projection which shows this changing."
"@neelkashkari @StephanieKelton 1/2 This is key because the deficit cannot truly be a contra asset to tax receivables if the tax payer is not paying it back (which they historically have not &amp; which the CBO projects they cannot - since all CBO projections show the deficit growing more than cumulative interest)."

One involves taxing income with progressive rates (after all, rich people usually make more money)  The other involves collecting massive amount of data on what rich and poor people buy and assigning each good a tax rate."
"@Omri_Marian @AlexParkerDC @ne0liberal I think it<U+0092>s time that we wrap up this conversation.  There are a lot of tax questions that aren<U+0092>t simple, but I believe this one is.  But to be clear<U+0097>you don<U+0092>t think one can reasonably say that it<U+0092>s easier to design a progressive income tax than a progressive consumption tax?"

I<U+0092>m pro sin taxes on carbon, cigarettes, alcohol, unhealthy food, etc.  That<U+0092>s different than restructuring our tax system.  A progressive income tax is quite simple, especially if we get rid of deductions and loopholes.  A progressive consumption tax is not."

"@Omri_Marian @AlexParkerDC @ne0liberal I<U+0092>m getting at that is much much easier to design a progressive income tax with simply just new brackets.  5% consumption tax is flat.  Designing progressive consumption tax requires a massive study on spending in America to even attempt."
"@Omri_Marian @AlexParkerDC @ne0liberal I don<U+0092>t think you<U+0092>re understanding what I<U+0092>m saying so I want to be very clear.  A progressive income tax is simple.  Simply different brackets.    How would you achieve the same effect where rich people pay higher tax rates than the poor while holding spending constant?"

Tax luxury items at higher rates. Consumption taxes are not regressive by a force of nature. They are regressive by design."

"@EvilHamsterEnt @LastFirstism @Doritos_Xtreme @SnellSZN @mkebucks34 I disagree, I think we should give credits (tax breaks) to poor people.  Also the US needs to instiute a federal consumption tax. We are the only developed nation that does not have one."

"@EvilHamsterEnt @LastFirstism @Doritos_Xtreme @SnellSZN @mkebucks34 40 or 50 years ago, we would get much more tax dollars per $1 of product produced.

"\"Losing: The US Treasury Because of all these tax cuts -- and especially the corporate cuts -- budget deficits are expected to skyrocket past $1 trillion per year starting in 2022 and stay there.\" BS. 2018 tax revenues are actually up. We need to spend less, not tax more!"
"Continued from above - \"That means that most Americans will not itemize their tax returns and that caps on state and local tax deductions may not affect as many people as feared.\""
"\"Losing: People who thought a tax cut would mean a bigger refund\" Again, a super misleading headline. Of returns filed so far, the average tax liability is down nearly 25%, and the IRS is withholding less from workers paychecks so the tax cut is spread throughout the year."
"\"Winning: Red state filers who depend on refunds...it is mostly red states, those that voted for Trump in 2016, who are getting the largest bump in tax refunds.\" Again, misleading. As if this has to do with how they voted and not the average income in those states. SMH."
"\"Losing: Blue state filers who depend on refunds.\" Again, completely misleading headline. As if those who voted blue are being punished somehow. Right. You should aim to have no refund and no tax due on tax day."
"At least they got to the truth eventually -  \"some of the states with the largest decreases in tax liability are blue states with high state and local taxes, like New Jersey, California and Massachusetts. Filers in these high tax states averaged some of the largest tax cuts."
"\"Winning: Most rich people. The new tax law's benefits are tilted toward the wealthy, who will generally see greater benefits than other Americans.\" This is misleading - the top 95-99 percentile pay the lion's share of income tax anyway. Of course they'll benefit."
"\"Most people in the bottom 20% income-wise will see little or no change in their tax liability.\" This too, is misleading. The bottom 20% have no real tax liability aside from medicare and social security contributions anyway. You cant subtract something from nothing."
"@CNN, as usual, has a real funny way of describing the facts. At least they started out with the truth...\"The vast majority of American tax filers -- more than 65% -- will see their overall tax burden decrease by at least $100\" #TaxDay https://t.co/llOekwfyrf"
"\"Winning: Trump, maybe, although some other business owners won't win as much.\" Again, misleading AND a dig at @POTUS. Those who have S corporations and include their profits on their personal income tax returns instead of corporate returns (many small businesses) will save big."
"\"Winning: People doing their own taxes There was a 2.3% increase in the number of e-filed tax returns self-prepared by the filer, according to that IRS data from March 29.\" We were promised a simplification and the Tax Cuts and Jobs act Delivered."
"\"With the national debt over $22 trillion, that means the US will ultimately have to make some hard choices. So enjoy that tax cut, everyone.\" Good. Great way to end the article. I will enjoy my tax cut. Hopefully our elected officials will stop recklessly spending OUR money!"
