By Scott Kirsner, Globe ColumnistI was told by an individual close to the deal that the purchase price was roughly $135 million in cash, and that's what other outlets have been reporting today. (The company had raised about $20 million in venture capital since being founded as uLocate in 2004.) Where Inc. executives say that the company will maintain an office in Boston, and will likely add to its current employee count of 120. Doyle says the company grew from 30 employees to 120 over the past 18 months.Where Inc. had originally tried to sell a service that would enable family members to get information about one another's location using their mobile devices; more recently, it has been focused on operating an advertising network that reaches mobile phone users, and promoting its own mobile app to help consumers find relevant businesses around them (and also potentially delivering discounts.) Doyle is the company's third CEO."This is a very strategic acquisition by eBay," says Charley Lax, managing partner at Grand Banks Capital in Wellesley, which originally incubated the start-up in its offices. "This is a company that was at the dance with a lot of people over the years," Lax says, suggesting that several other players had made attempts to acquire the company. Lax told me that the $135 million purchase figure was wrong, but he wouldn't say whether it was high or low."We just don't disclose any terms of the deal," says eBay spokesperson Kathy Chui.PayPal executive Amanda Pines explained the acquisition this way in a blog post this morning:Where CEO Doyle says that the company will be focused going forward on using its mobile app to "drive foot traffic to merchants," and presumably using PayPal to consummate transactions. "It's about frictionless and contextual commerce for the consumer," Doyle says. He says he'll remain in Boston, rather than moving to PayPal's San Jose headquarters: "This is all about Boston. I lived out west for eight years. I did my Valley time."Boston has seen a string of five major mobile acquisitions over the past few years, Doyle notes, including Apple buying Quattro Wireless for $275 million and VeriSign buying m-Qube for $250 million. "Boston is a tremendous hub for mobile development," Doyle says. (I'd ask: is "hub" the right term, or "shopping mall for big tech players"?)Here's PayPal's blog post on the deal, along with coverage from Mass High Tech, TechCrunch, and BostInnovation.eBay's most recent prior purchase in the Boston area took place in 2003, when the company bought the assets of the publicly-traded auction site FairMarket for $4.5 million in cash; that company's Web site no longer exists, and the phone number no longer works. eBay also picked up Boston-based "flash sale" site Rue La La last month, as part of an acquisition of GSI Commerce, but eBay plans to spin that company out again.

The company gave an assurance in this regard to a delegation of Tamil Nadu officials, which visited China last week, according to a senior government official.The delegation was led by Tamil Nadu deputy chief minister M K Stalin. The state government had earlier said that it was expecting investments to the tune of around RsÂ  3,000 crore (Rs 30 billion) from China and Korea in the next two years, which would generate around 10,000 direct and indirect jobs. Speaking to Business Standard on the sidelines of TPM national conference, organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry, state industries secretary Rajeev Ranjan said, "We have met the management (of Huawei) and they confirmed that they propose to invest in the state to set up a telecom equipment manufacturing facility."Skills training programmeRanjan said that the state government had taken up an integrated skills development scheme aimed at providing training to over 100,000 people in the next six months. The government has identified 15 sectors like (mainly sub sectors of manufacturing), leather, automotive and chemical."The government has allocated RsÂ  50 crore for the programme, which will be taken up as a pilot. We will extend our support by giving RsÂ  6,000 per person," Ranjan said.The training would be provided through government institutions like power loom and weavers service centres and textiles research associations, and apparel training and design centres. Â The scheme would be implemented mostly through government agencies and the rest through private-public partnership model.Ranjan said that the state had 456 colleges and 130,000 engineering students were passing out from these colleges every year. "Whether they are employable is the issue. To fill this gap and to support the industry, we have decided to take up this programme," he added.

          sorry to say that Aardvark Business has now closed.It's 
          been a pleasure running it for over 8 years but sadly all things have 
          to come to an end. Paul, who is the person initially behind the site,

          continue to manage the Aardvark websites.Of 
          all the Aardvark websites, Aardvark Travel was by far the most popular 
          and those of you who enjoyed engaging in the regular travel discussions 
          on the forums there are invited to visit 'A 
          Luxury Travel Blog' and continue your discussions via the comments

Outside of China, similar customs exist across parts of South East Asia and many other countries with a sizable ethnic Chinese population.Red envelopes are gifts presented at social and family gatherings such as weddings or holidays such as Chinese New Year. The red color of the envelope symbolizes good luck and is a symbol to ward off evil spirits. The act of requesting red packets is normally called tao hongbao (Chinese: è¨ç´å; pinyin: tÇo hÃ³ngbÄo) or yao lishi (Chinese: è¦å©æ¯; pinyin: yÃ o lÃ¬ shÃ¬), and in the south of China, lai see (Chinese: éå©æ¯; pinyin: dÃ²u lÃ¬ shÃ¬; Cantonese Yale: dau6 lai6 si6). Red envelopes are usually given out by married couples to single people, regardless of age, or by older to younger ones during holidays and festivals.Related Tags : 1Adress: No 122,XianWu Industrial Park Guanlan Street,Longhua District,Shenzhen+86-755-2908576113444159305Copyright Â© 2019 Darshan Color World Industrial(HK) Limited.All Rights Reserved.

In 2016 and 2015, acquisitions were not significant.Acquisitions of controlling interests have been accounted for under the acquisition method and have been included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of acquisition.While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, the purchase price allocation for acquisitions is preliminary for up to 12 months after the acquisition date and is subject to refinement as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information about the fair values of the assets and liabilities becomes available.On July 6, 2017, the Company acquired the shares of B&R, a worldwide provider of product- and software-based, open-architecture solutions for machine and factory automation. This acquisition closes a gap in the Company’s industrial automation portfolio and consequently the goodwill acquired represents the future benefits associated with product portfolio expansion.The aggregate preliminary allocation of the purchase consideration for business acquisitions in 2017, was as follows:(XLS:) Download Excel($ in millions)Allocated amountsWeighted-average useful life(1)The Company does not expect the goodwill recognized to be deductible for income tax purposes.(2)Primarily relates to the acquisition of B&R.Technology4347 yearsCustomer Relationships29219 yearsTrade names6510 yearsOrder backlog13 monthsIntangible assets792 Fixed assets131 Debt acquired(50) Deferred tax liabilities(255) Inventories177 Other assets and liabilities, net(21) Goodwill(1)1,337 Total consideration (net of cash acquired)(2)2,111 In 2017, the Company received proceeds (net of transaction costs and cash disposed) of $605 million, relating to divestments of consolidated businesses and recorded net gains of $252 million in “Other income (expense), net” on the sale of such businesses. These are primarily due to the divestment of the Company’s high-voltage cables and cable accessories businesses (the Cables business) in March 2017 and the divestment of the Oil & Gas EPC business in December 2017.The Company has retained certain obligations of the Cables business and thus the Company remains directly or indirectly liable for these liabilities which existed at the date of the divestment. Subsequent to the divestment, the Company recorded a loss of $94 million for changes in the amounts recorded for these obligations. In addition, the Company has provided certain performance guarantees to third parties which guarantee the performance of the buyer under existing contracts with customers as well as for certain capital expenditures of the divested business.In 2016 and 2015, there were no significant amounts recognized from divestments of consolidated businesses.On September 25, 2017, the Company announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire General Electric Company’s (GE) Industrial Solutions business, GE’s global electrification solutions business, for $2.6 billion. The Company expects to close the acquisition of GE Industrial Solutions in the first half of 2018, following the receipt of customary regulatory approvals.Business Bulletin 1999-2011Minutes of Proceedings 1999-2011Journal of Parliamentary Proceedings Sessions 1 & 2 Committees Sessions 1, 2 & 3 Annual reportsThe sections which appear in today’s Business Bulletin are in bold Section A: 		Today’s Business-	Meetings of Committees-	Meeting of the ParliamentSection B: Future Meetings of the ParliamentSection C: Future Meetings of CommitteesSection D: Oral Questions-	Questions selected for First Minister’s Question Time -	Questions selected for response by Ministers and junior Scottish Ministers at Question TimeSection E: Written Questions – new questions for written answer Section F: Motions and Amendments Section G: Bills-	New Bills introduced-	New amendments to Bills-	Members’ Bills proposalsSection H: New Documents – new documents laid before the Parliament and committee reports publishedSection I: Petitions – new public petitions Section J: Progress of Legislation – progress of Bills and subordinate legislationThis section is from the book "Handbook Of The Law Of Contracts", by Wm.

At common law, upon a woman's marriage the right to reduce her choses in action into possession is transferred to her husband, and he becomes liable jointly with her. during coverture, upon her antenuptial contracts. These rules are changed by statute in most jurisdictions.At common law, a married woman is disabled from acquiring the benefits of her antenuptial contract, because she cannot sue upon it apart from her husband, and she may lose them altogether, for they are vested conditionally in the husband, who may take them to himself by reduction into possession of the chose in action. He may also sue jointly with his wife for what is due on her contracts. Whatever is thus obtained passes absolutely to him.' If the husband does not thus reduce his wife's choses in action into his possession, they survive to her if he dies first, or pass to her representatives if she dies in his lifetime.N.

By Kate Faulkner, Managing Director at Designs on Property in For Landlords.With a new government in place, both the property industry and tenant and landlord groups and organisations will be keen to promote their ideas and thoughts about changes to the Private Rented Sector that would help the market work better for everyone involved.Earlier this year, I produced a comprehensive report on the Private Rented Sector (PRS), which looked at how the market worked from the various perspectives of an agent, a landlord and, of course, a tenant.Interestingly, my conclusion was that most of the PRS works really well. According to a government report, around 78% of landlords have just one property*, so they aren’t the ‘career’ landlords who are often accused of trying to squeeze
  every penny they can out of tenants.Most landlords just want to let a decent property at a fair rent and many hope that if the tenant is a good one, they will stay for a long time. This is great news for tenants, as one of the ways landlords always aim to keep the best tenants is by not
  increasing the rent unless they have to.Nationally, rent inflation for existing tenants in the same property is extremely low; the downside for tenants being that they often suddenly have to pay a lot more when they eventually move to another property - as will the new tenants that take on
  the existing property.In my view, the PRS needs some changes to make it better for all, but most of these are easy to implement and don’t require huge amounts of government intervention.One of the major problems is that many landlords and tenants don’t consider whether a property is legally let – or even know what the requirements are.I would like to see the government publish a clear list of 15 major checks that any landlord and tenant should make on a property. Steps have already been taken, with their ‘How to Rent’ Guide (link: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-rent).Next, although all letting agents now have to be a member of an Ombudsman, so that landlords and tenants have access to a free complaints procedure, I don’t think this is enough. No letting agent should be holding rent without Client Money Protection insurance,
  which means if something goes wrong in the business, the rent money is protected.More needs to be done to encourage landlords to keep the PRS well stocked with good-quality accommodation. Unnecessary rent controls could put people off investing in much needed rental stock, and taxation must be such
  that it motivates landlords to keep their property in good condition.One of the big frustrations for all good landlords and letting agents is that there is little enforcement of the rules and regulations – and this can lead to the ‘good guys’ losing business to rogues. We have to be able to easily
  identify at a local level which properties are privately rented and where licensing landlords won’t help, as only the good will apply! A great idea from the Residential Landlords Association was a tick box on council tax forms  that are filled in by tenants, to say a property is rented.Once local authorities can identify rented properties and agents, they can better ensure they are operating legally and do so cost effectively, or get help from other sources. For example, Shelter are planning to launch a pilot scheme
  in Dundee later this year that will support the local authority with a ‘private renting support officer’ whose job will be to help landlords ensure they’re operating legally.Secondly, from an enforcement perspective, there is little or no funding for new regulations to be promoted when they are introduced – let alone enforced. And if local authorities do fine landlords or agents, they don’t necessarily plough
  that money back into more enforcement, which would seem to be the sensible thing.So, monies need to be made available to educate and enforce existing and new letting laws.Bringing out rules and regulations one after another is increasing the cost of providing a good lettings service for landlords and agents. Both on and off-line there is a huge amount of misinformation and some of the rules, for example electrical safety,
  are ambiguous and need to be clarified.To keep up with the latest rules and regulations, mandatory CPD training is needed for all of the PRS – including lenders, insurers, housing charities/organisations and housing associations, as well as landlords and letting agents.
  And from a tenant perspective, many young people will now rent rather than buy, so adding ‘how to rent’ to the national curriculum would be really helpful to the next generation.The full report is available at Propertychecklists.co.uk  *https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/7249/2010380.pdf

(The company had raised about $20 million in venture capital since being founded as uLocate in 2004.) Where Inc. executives say that the company will maintain an office in Boston, and will likely add to its current employee count of 120. Doyle says the company grew from 30 employees to 120 over the past 18 months.Where Inc. had originally tried to sell a service that would enable family members to get information about one another's location using their mobile devices; more recently, it has been focused on operating an advertising network that reaches mobile phone users, and promoting its own mobile app to help consumers find relevant businesses around them (and also potentially delivering discounts.) Doyle is the company's third CEO."This is a very strategic acquisition by eBay," says Charley Lax, managing partner at Grand Banks Capital in Wellesley, which originally incubated the start-up in its offices. "This is a company that was at the dance with a lot of people over the years," Lax says, suggesting that several other players had made attempts to acquire the company. Lax told me that the $135 million purchase figure was wrong, but he wouldn't say whether it was high or low."We just don't disclose any terms of the deal," says eBay spokesperson Kathy Chui.PayPal executive Amanda Pines explained the acquisition this way in a blog post this morning:Where CEO Doyle says that the company will be focused going forward on using its mobile app to "drive foot traffic to merchants," and presumably using PayPal to consummate transactions. "It's about frictionless and contextual commerce for the consumer," Doyle says. He says he'll remain in Boston, rather than moving to PayPal's San Jose headquarters: "This is all about Boston. I lived out west for eight years. I did my Valley time."Boston has seen a string of five major mobile acquisitions over the past few years, Doyle notes, including Apple buying Quattro Wireless for $275 million and VeriSign buying m-Qube for $250 million. "Boston is a tremendous hub for mobile development," Doyle says. (I'd ask: is "hub" the right term, or "shopping mall for big tech players"?)Here's PayPal's blog post on the deal, along with coverage from Mass High Tech, TechCrunch, and BostInnovation.eBay's most recent prior purchase in the Boston area took place in 2003, when the company bought the assets of the publicly-traded auction site FairMarket for $4.5 million in cash; that company's Web site no longer exists, and the phone number no longer works. eBay also picked up Boston-based "flash sale" site Rue La La last month, as part of an acquisition of GSI Commerce, but eBay plans to spin that company out again.

The company gave an assurance in this regard to a delegation of Tamil Nadu officials, which visited China last week, according to a senior government official.The delegation was led by Tamil Nadu deputy chief minister M K Stalin. The state government had earlier said that it was expecting investments to the tune of around RsÂ  3,000 crore (Rs 30 billion) from China and Korea in the next two years, which would generate around 10,000 direct and indirect jobs. Speaking to Business Standard on the sidelines of TPM national conference, organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry, state industries secretary Rajeev Ranjan said, "We have met the management (of Huawei) and they confirmed that they propose to invest in the state to set up a telecom equipment manufacturing facility."Skills training programmeRanjan said that the state government had taken up an integrated skills development scheme aimed at providing training to over 100,000 people in the next six months. The government has identified 15 sectors like (mainly sub sectors of manufacturing), leather, automotive and chemical."The government has allocated RsÂ  50 crore for the programme, which will be taken up as a pilot. We will extend our support by giving RsÂ  6,000 per person," Ranjan said.The training would be provided through government institutions like power loom and weavers service centres and textiles research associations, and apparel training and design centres. Â The scheme would be implemented mostly through government agencies and the rest through private-public partnership model.Ranjan said that the state had 456 colleges and 130,000 engineering students were passing out from these colleges every year. "Whether they are employable is the issue. To fill this gap and to support the industry, we have decided to take up this programme," he added. Moneywiz Live!ï»¿

Outside of China, similar customs exist across parts of South East Asia and many other countries with a sizable ethnic Chinese population.Red envelopes are gifts presented at social and family gatherings such as weddings or holidays such as Chinese New Year. The red color of the envelope symbolizes good luck and is a symbol to ward off evil spirits. The act of requesting red packets is normally called tao hongbao (Chinese: è¨ç´å; pinyin: tÇo hÃ³ngbÄo) or yao lishi (Chinese: è¦å©æ¯; pinyin: yÃ o lÃ¬ shÃ¬), and in the south of China, lai see (Chinese: éå©æ¯; pinyin: dÃ²u lÃ¬ shÃ¬; Cantonese Yale: dau6 lai6 si6). Red envelopes are usually given out by married couples to single people, regardless of age, or by older to younger ones during holidays and festivals.Related Tags : 1Adress: No 122,XianWu Industrial Park Guanlan Street,Longhua District,Shenzhen+86-755-2908576113444159305Copyright Â© 2019 Darshan Color World Industrial(HK) Limited.All Rights Reserved.

In 2016 and 2015, acquisitions were not significant.Acquisitions of controlling interests have been accounted for under the acquisition method and have been included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of acquisition.While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, the purchase price allocation for acquisitions is preliminary for up to 12 months after the acquisition date and is subject to refinement as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information about the fair values of the assets and liabilities becomes available.On July 6, 2017, the Company acquired the shares of B&R, a worldwide provider of product- and software-based, open-architecture solutions for machine and factory automation. This acquisition closes a gap in the Company’s industrial automation portfolio and consequently the goodwill acquired represents the future benefits associated with product portfolio expansion.The aggregate preliminary allocation of the purchase consideration for business acquisitions in 2017, was as follows:(XLS:) Download Excel($ in millions)Allocated amountsWeighted-average useful life(1)The Company does not expect the goodwill recognized to be deductible for income tax purposes.(2)Primarily relates to the acquisition of B&R.Technology4347 yearsCustomer Relationships29219 yearsTrade names6510 yearsOrder backlog13 monthsIntangible assets792 Fixed assets131 Debt acquired(50) Deferred tax liabilities(255) Inventories177 Other assets and liabilities, net(21) Goodwill(1)1,337 Total consideration (net of cash acquired)(2)2,111 In 2017, the Company received proceeds (net of transaction costs and cash disposed) of $605 million, relating to divestments of consolidated businesses and recorded net gains of $252 million in “Other income (expense), net” on the sale of such businesses. These are primarily due to the divestment of the Company’s high-voltage cables and cable accessories businesses (the Cables business) in March 2017 and the divestment of the Oil & Gas EPC business in December 2017.The Company has retained certain obligations of the Cables business and thus the Company remains directly or indirectly liable for these liabilities which existed at the date of the divestment. Subsequent to the divestment, the Company recorded a loss of $94 million for changes in the amounts recorded for these obligations. In addition, the Company has provided certain performance guarantees to third parties which guarantee the performance of the buyer under existing contracts with customers as well as for certain capital expenditures of the divested business.In 2016 and 2015, there were no significant amounts recognized from divestments of consolidated businesses.On September 25, 2017, the Company announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire General Electric Company’s (GE) Industrial Solutions business, GE’s global electrification solutions business, for $2.6 billion. The Company expects to close the acquisition of GE Industrial Solutions in the first half of 2018, following the receipt of customary regulatory approvals.Business Bulletin 1999-2011Minutes of Proceedings 1999-2011Journal of Parliamentary Proceedings Sessions 1 & 2 Committees Sessions 1, 2 & 3 Annual reportsThe sections which appear in today’s Business Bulletin are in bold Section A: 		Today’s Business-	Meetings of Committees-	Meeting of the ParliamentSection B: Future Meetings of the ParliamentSection C: Future Meetings of CommitteesSection D: Oral Questions-	Questions selected for First Minister’s Question Time -	Questions selected for response by Ministers and junior Scottish Ministers at Question TimeSection E: Written Questions – new questions for written answer Section F: Motions and Amendments Section G: Bills-	New Bills introduced-	New amendments to Bills-	Members’ Bills proposalsSection H: New Documents – new documents laid before the Parliament and committee reports publishedSection I: Petitions – new public petitions Section J: Progress of Legislation – progress of Bills and subordinate legislationThis section is from the book "Handbook Of The Law Of Contracts", by Wm.

At common law, upon a woman's marriage the right to reduce her choses in action into possession is transferred to her husband, and he becomes liable jointly with her. during coverture, upon her antenuptial contracts. These rules are changed by statute in most jurisdictions.At common law, a married woman is disabled from acquiring the benefits of her antenuptial contract, because she cannot sue upon it apart from her husband, and she may lose them altogether, for they are vested conditionally in the husband, who may take them to himself by reduction into possession of the chose in action. He may also sue jointly with his wife for what is due on her contracts. Whatever is thus obtained passes absolutely to him.' If the husband does not thus reduce his wife's choses in action into his possession, they survive to her if he dies first, or pass to her representatives if she dies in his lifetime.N.

By Kate Faulkner, Managing Director at Designs on Property in For Landlords.With a new government in place, both the property industry and tenant and landlord groups and organisations will be keen to promote their ideas and thoughts about changes to the Private Rented Sector that would help the market work better for everyone involved.Earlier this year, I produced a comprehensive report on the Private Rented Sector (PRS), which looked at how the market worked from the various perspectives of an agent, a landlord and, of course, a tenant.Interestingly, my conclusion was that most of the PRS works really well. According to a government report, around 78% of landlords have just one property*, so they aren’t the ‘career’ landlords who are often accused of trying to squeeze
  every penny they can out of tenants.Most landlords just want to let a decent property at a fair rent and many hope that if the tenant is a good one, they will stay for a long time. This is great news for tenants, as one of the ways landlords always aim to keep the best tenants is by not
  increasing the rent unless they have to.Nationally, rent inflation for existing tenants in the same property is extremely low; the downside for tenants being that they often suddenly have to pay a lot more when they eventually move to another property - as will the new tenants that take on
  the existing property.In my view, the PRS needs some changes to make it better for all, but most of these are easy to implement and don’t require huge amounts of government intervention.One of the major problems is that many landlords and tenants don’t consider whether a property is legally let – or even know what the requirements are.I would like to see the government publish a clear list of 15 major checks that any landlord and tenant should make on a property. Steps have already been taken, with their ‘How to Rent’ Guide (link: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-rent).Next, although all letting agents now have to be a member of an Ombudsman, so that landlords and tenants have access to a free complaints procedure, I don’t think this is enough. No letting agent should be holding rent without Client Money Protection insurance,
  which means if something goes wrong in the business, the rent money is protected.More needs to be done to encourage landlords to keep the PRS well stocked with good-quality accommodation. Unnecessary rent controls could put people off investing in much needed rental stock, and taxation must be such
  that it motivates landlords to keep their property in good condition.One of the big frustrations for all good landlords and letting agents is that there is little enforcement of the rules and regulations – and this can lead to the ‘good guys’ losing business to rogues. We have to be able to easily
  identify at a local level which properties are privately rented and where licensing landlords won’t help, as only the good will apply! A great idea from the Residential Landlords Association was a tick box on council tax forms  that are filled in by tenants, to say a property is rented.Once local authorities can identify rented properties and agents, they can better ensure they are operating legally and do so cost effectively, or get help from other sources. For example, Shelter are planning to launch a pilot scheme
  in Dundee later this year that will support the local authority with a ‘private renting support officer’ whose job will be to help landlords ensure they’re operating legally.Secondly, from an enforcement perspective, there is little or no funding for new regulations to be promoted when they are introduced – let alone enforced. And if local authorities do fine landlords or agents, they don’t necessarily plough
  that money back into more enforcement, which would seem to be the sensible thing.So, monies need to be made available to educate and enforce existing and new letting laws.Bringing out rules and regulations one after another is increasing the cost of providing a good lettings service for landlords and agents. Both on and off-line there is a huge amount of misinformation and some of the rules, for example electrical safety,
  are ambiguous and need to be clarified.To keep up with the latest rules and regulations, mandatory CPD training is needed for all of the PRS – including lenders, insurers, housing charities/organisations and housing associations, as well as landlords and letting agents.
  And from a tenant perspective, many young people will now rent rather than buy, so adding ‘how to rent’ to the national curriculum would be really helpful to the next generation.The full report is available at Propertychecklists.co.uk  *https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/7249/2010380.pdf

(TSX-V: SNN) ("Sintana" or the "Company") announces that it has been notified by the Operator of the Talora Block that the Dorados-1X exploration well commenced drilling operations on July 31, 2012.The Company previously announced an agreement with Petrodorado Energy Ltd. (TSX-V: PDQ) to farm-in for an undivided 30% interest in the 58,570 acre Talora Block located in Colombia's prolific Magdalena Basin. The Talora Block, which is operated by Petrodorado, is immediately adjacent to the region's main oil and gas pipelines and only 60 kilometers west of the capital city of Bogota.  Given this close proximity to infrastructure, conversion of a discovery to a commercial well is expected to be a relatively quick process.The well, which is targeting the Cretaceous Caballos and Tetuan formations, is presently drilling ahead at a depth of 2,500 feet to a planned total depth of 9,500 feet. The Company will earn a 30% private participation interest in the well by paying 60% of the well costs, subject to a cap of US$6.5 Million (gross). Costs above the cap are to be paid proportionally by each partner based on their respective participation interests.In Peru, planning has commenced for a seismic program on Bayovar Block XXVII (Sintana â 25%), located in the Sechura Basin.  Faulkner Exploration, as operator, previously drilled the SC-4X seismic control well.  Open hole log data from the well is being incorporated into the design of the seismic shoot.  Post processing and analysis, optimum locations for subsequent wells will be selected based on this seismic. The SC 4X control well reached a TD of 5,276 feet and encountered the target reservoirs 500 feet lower than anticipated.  Open hole log evaluations identified a continuous column of rich gas shows from the 1,496 feet of gross Paleozoic section penetrated, starting at 3,780 feet.  Imagery logs depict a high density fracture system with a network of fracture intersections. The Operator reported that during testing the highly fractured target interval collapsed which prevented completion of the well. The objective of gathering open hole log data on the stratigraphic section on the block was achieved and indications of hydrocarbons at this location are considered a significant bonus.Doug Manner, CEO of Sintana commented "We are excited about commencing the Talora exploration drilling program and look forward to completing the seismic program at Bayovar. We anticipate having drilling results for the Dorados-1X well in September."

				M15 6SEdigitalenergy professional is a unique cloud based energy management system that helps organisations manage their building energy portfolio by reducing costs, resources and compliance risks.It is the only system that incorporates the entire range of tasks within an energy estate, from monitoring and targeting, right through to compliance audits and evidence trails.digitalenergy professional is a unique "one system for all" energy management software platform that can be accessed at different levels across diverse asset portfolios.Onscreen interfaces, dashboards and reports are equally accessible through desktop, laptop, tablet or mobile devices.Focus your stakeholder engagement on reducing costs, reducing carbon, whilst at the same time safeguarding your organisation against compliance legislation.Accurate data and utility bill management has long been an area of concern for energy consumers. Inaccurate invoices place a substantial cost burden on energy users yet many customers do not have the time or resource to resolve billing issues themselves.Switching suppliers can also lead to incorrect data input and consumption data is frequently estimated, with some companies having meters read as little as once a year. digitalenergy professional can be used for full invoice checking and bill validation in a pre or post payment process. Invoices are compared against a calculation of the correct charges that should have been applied according to the supply contracts currently in place and variances reported to the tolerances that you desire – allowing a small margin for error or down to the last penny! The validation cycle can be configured through an easy to use interface to check against: ·         Ownership and address validations·         Ensuring correct sites are billed.·         MPAN/MPRN and Serial Numbers·         Half Hourly Data (HHD)/meter read consistency.·         Missing invoices/meters.·         Estimated/actual meter read frequency·         The accuracy of billing dates.·         Transportation charges and reconciliations·         Triad charges and reconciliations·         All unit rates and charges (supplier contract).·         All published rates and charges (DuOS/TuOS)           : Launching September 2016·         Tax allocation (CCL and VAT) The system also has a powerful query manager to enable you to log actions taken to resolve issues with suppliers, data collectors or brokers. If you have tenants you can also take advantaged of the reporting system for automated recharging from validated data. High energy consuming public and private sector organisations have a requirement to demonstrate compliance to the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme to improve energy efficiency and cut carbon dioxide emissions.The CRC Management application will enable organisations to manage compliance throughout their CRC phases:·        Collate and calculate carbon footprint data at building level·        View carbon emissions generated by month and year·        Set and manage annual carbon reduction targets and cost savings·        Carbon and energy consumption reports·        Upload and maintain documentation for CRC evidence pack·        Analyse and compare year on year carbon footprints·        Reporting deadline timeline to manage progress through CRC phases User Benefits include:·        Saves time and resources for multisites, by managing CRC online in one system·        Instant access to reports and documentation required for CRC audit evidence packs·        Removes the risk of errors in data and time consuming paper based methods·        An efficient way to achieve year on year reduction in carbon emissionsdigitalenergy professional solves the problem of ‘lack of awareness’ evident in many organisations by allowing access to different types of user across your business. Whether it’s your accounts team needing to see invoice, supplier and cost information or a director requiring a simple but clear picture of organisational consumption and spend, there’s a meaningful view for everyone.Energy Updates sent via e-mail are also a useful tool and digitalenergy can even take this a step further by placing dashboards in high footfall areas within your business to ensure energy awareness extends to as many people as possible. Manchester Science Park

 I am an experienced psychiatrist with 40 years of very full-time practice behind me. During my training we were encouraged to undergo psychoanalysis which I did faithfully for 15 years, four times a week. Over the last 10 years family problems have caused me to seek out supportive psychological help with various therapists with substantial degrees.

		
Despite all this "treatment," it wasn't until I found Susana Sori that I really began to change. Her insights, knowledge, and warmth have helped me grow. I never even realized before the dimensions in my life that were missing until she began enlightening me. I began to understand that the challenges I was facing were there so that I could change and grow.

		
Her energy work is astounding. I have never met Susana face to face (we do our work over the telephone), but I feel that she is one of the closest people in my life. She understands me and my issues immediately and always has a new path to help me. As a psychiatrists, I have prescribed medication and traditional psychoanalytic and supportive psychotherapy to thousands of patients. What Susana does is a higher elevation of my traditional work.

		
I heartily recommend her to all souls in trouble or those who want to enlighten themselves.

Sharings resulting from First Session with Susana 
		SorÃ­I wanted to let you know that the first impression I had, once left the session with you, was an increased sense of my inner intuition about even the simplest things. For example: on my way back home from your place, instead of checking on the map or trying to remember with my mind my way back (as I would have done in the past, fearing to get lost) I followed my intuition, as if some "higher" power inside me was driving me. I can count many other examples like this!
    Thanks!
    
A. from Miami, Florida

    
Since my session with you, which gave me great awareness and clarity on my life at this time, people around me immediately began behaving differently. One quality that stands out, is that people I've known for a while, all of a sudden have really trusted me about their intimate thoughts and emotions.
    Phone session client

    After our session, when I returned to work, one of my co-workers jokingly asked me if I had been smoking pot in the park. When I asked why she asked me that she said, 'Because you seem so happy.' The session apparently had quite an effect on me.

    Thank you for assisting me to 
        fulfill my dream. I really can feel the shift going on inside and just 
        more and more opportunities seem to be presenting themselves.
        S.L., Boston South Shore, MA

        My session with Susana was an experience with my true self. A lot of emotions that I carried deep inside were released and channeled properly to allow growth and regain confidence. She made me feel at home with myself since the very beginning and helped me see and confront what was stopping me to be in peace and grateful. She gives you a new beginning built upon your own strength.

Susana, thank you for all the help, guidance, advice and positive healing energy. You have made such a difference in my life. I am very grateful.

    Your sessions have worked wonders on my husband. He is a new man. He is exercising almost everyday and can communicate better with our son. It is truly amazing...just thought you would like to know!

I have noticed a steady lightness in my emotional state so I know that changes are happening even though I may not notice them right away!
		
M. F., Miami, FL

    
I have always found your sessions amazing, yet I now am beginning to understand why I have felt the process so much more deeply lately...You get to the root of core problems and your sessions are so powerful but in an almost gentle way...I just want to say thank you. I love "Susana style". I think that must be it, you put your whole being into it!
    T. O., New England Area

    Thank you so much for helping me mend my broken heart! 
S. K., Chicago, IL

    
Although I had my career in mind when signing up for the session, the result has been that my whole life has shifted. No small change, either...from nothing, to more opportunities that I can handle! Yes, it is a good thing!

Sharings resulting from Couples or Partners Sessions

    After our couple session, I somehow see my wife more clearly and thus more lovingly. I am looking forward to more experiences of this kind. Thank you! B.N., Houston, TX

    
I have been busy this past week and certainly did not have the session on my mind, yet, I found myself feeling grateful on several occasions. And, although I had to do some 'fearful' things, like speak my truth to my partner and express my feelings more, I felt I was supported and I could do them! The result has been that our love life has expanded and I feel much closer to my wife on many levels. We want to let you know that we appreciate all the wisdom, energy and love you gave us.

As my session with Susana, was done by proxy, I had no expectations I just knew that I was drawn to Susana's proxy workshop. The connection by proxy was deep and profound although non-invasive, upon reading my session report I was able to validate my experience with the experience of others in my group - I have never felt so strongly connected to what I read in the report, at the moment I am still speechless or as we say 'god-smacked' by the strength of the connection. - My session has left me with a profound sense of inner peace and personal freedom, I am looking forward to working with Susana again by proxy. Much appreciated and much love,

A raise I requested back in October has been approved, retroactive back to October; I accepted a job with more money and I am paying attention to savings/tax/retirement issues. I find it somewhat hard to believe that all these changes are really occurring during this workshop!
    	
P. P., Boston, MA

    
Many of my old patterns cleared and I have begun to feel a sense of normality that I have not felt in years. I have chosen to walk the road to financial wealth. The moment I made this choice I was invited and paid to do the work I love. A great blessing!

    This course is remarkable. I am feeling the effects as we move along. This course taps the root of my core issues."

The results of the series have been splendid. I experience a greater monthly income for half the work I did before.

I am continually grateful that early on in this course we organized and reviewed our finances. The big shift for me is that I no longer have FEAR or JUDGMENT around this. In fact, I now have absolute FAITH. Great job, Susana. This was definitely transformative and needed all the attention we gave it. Thank you for all the attention, skill, genius and love that you gave us - immense!

There are several credit information companies (CICs), such as Transunion, Equifax, Experian and CRIF High Mark, that provide the lending institutions with an individualâs credit score and credit report. Therefore, it is important for everyone to know the following things - what is a credit report, how is a credit report made, what is a credit score, and how to check the credit score. These are important to know even if you do not want to apply for loans or credit cards today. A good credit score will ensure that you have access to loans and credit cards from banks whenever you require themFirstly, the rules ensure that any person can get their credit report and credit score from the credit agencies by visiting their websites and requesting for the same. The normal process involves logging in to the website of the concerned agency and uploading the documents required by the agency to provide the credit report. Once this is done, the documents are verified, and the report is emailed to the user in a few days, provided that the user pays the associated charges.An easier and quicker alternative is to check your credit score for free at mymoneykarma. This gives you your credit score from Equifax instantly. Additionally, you also get a completely free detailed analysis of your credit report. This is for free, and we donât charge you anything. We will also keep a track of your credit score in the long run and advise you on how to maintain a good credit score.Credit report is like a report card made by credit bureau (or Credit Information Company) that contains your credit history with all the different lenders. It is a report that provides the details of an individualâs borrowing history and repayment record; it tells the prospective lenders whether the individual is a reliable borrower. A credit report includes the following information:Hence, a credit report provides the future lenders with data points on the applicantâs creditworthiness on the basis of previous and current credit behavior. The lenders take the lending decision based on the credit report.The Credit Information Companies (CIC) collect the records of your loans and credit cards. These records are made available to these companies by the banks and lenders on a regular basis as mandated by RBI. Based on this data, the CIC runs its algorithms to provide a credit score to each individual along with a detailed credit report that predicts a borrowerâs creditworthiness and financial track record.The process of calculating credit score begins once the credit information company receives the monthly data from the banks and other financial companies. This data is detailed at an account level, and it captures all customer activities such as repayments, interest rates, new applications, closures of loans, defaults, settlements, etc. This data is then run through complex algorithms that provide the credit score and the credit report.A good credit score in India will be the basic determinant of oneâs access to credit. This is because all lenders require a good credit score as an eligibility criteria to grant more credit. You can get a good credit score by paying your bills on time, monitoring your credit usage and avoiding shopping for credit with multiple lenders.MINUTES OF EXTRAORDINARY COUNCIL MEETING OF THECOUNCIL OF THE CITY OF RANDWICKHELD ON TUESDAY, AT 9TH  SEPTEMBER, 2003 AT 6:32 P.M.  PRESENT: His Worship the

discharged through this property's stormwater system.  Such drainage must, if
necessary, be constructed prior to the commencement of building work. 117.     On-site
detention must be provided to ensure that the maximum discharge from the above
site is not to exceed that which would occur during a 1 in 10 year storm of 1
hour duration for the existing site conditions.  All other stormwater run-off
from the above site for all storms up to the 1 in 20 year storm is to be
retained on the site for gradual release to the kerb and gutter or drainage
system as required by the Director of Assets and Infrastructure Services. 
Provision is to be made for satisfactory overland flow should a storm in excess
of the above parameters occur. For small areas up to 0.5
hectares, determination of the required cumulative storage must be calculated
by the mass curve technique as detailed in Technical Note 1, Chapter 14 of the
Australian Rainfall and Run-off Volume 1, 1987 Edition.  Where possible the
detention tank must have an open base to infiltrate stormwater to the groundwater.
Note that the ground water and any rock stratum has to be a minimum of 2.0
metres below the base of the tank. 118.     All
stormwater leaving the site must be discharged by gravity to Councils

Or taking 100 bloggers from some random city to a new movie a week before it comes out and letting them write about it.I think that would make Tumblr a news outlet or at least a review site. Maybe that would work. What do I know. But I don't think the problem is that we have too few armatures publishing opinions. Medium is making a good go of it with that model and it's not exactly blowing the doors off of the place. I think the problem is that to be successful with ads you need to be an advertising company that owns the entire stack â like Facebook or Google.Tumblr ads were low quality and poorly targeted. It was a makeup shotgun. For the advertisers that only have 4/5ths of a second to make an impression. I don't think that works now.RSS // Copyright Vagabond Industries LLC, 2018



 Mar 2, - He spent one full hour day dedicated to energy, health and vitality. an acid environment your cells retain fat to protect themselves from the.Over the years BGG has grown into a pretty whiny place. Complaints abound about anything really. And it would of only affected you if you had your front page on "Hot" protection from energy pathfinder most never saw the problem. And then once an admin gets attracted to the complaint of the day, then it turns into a mess. Especially when Octavian gets involved since he tends to be the most ruthless dealing out pain. Also, thumbing is part of telling people what you like and a built in function of the site.We shouldn't feel like we can't thumb for steed stone skyrim of an admin swinging in with punishment. That was a wild time of mock outrage and those defending the publisher. With the thread locking bat being used generously.BGG isn't the friendly place it protection from energy pathfinder to be. The first image is the original, and the second is an update Kerem made. Well, a handful of backers were upset with the image.The argument is that images like this "objectify" or "sexualize" women. I thought it was rather tame and showed a woman in a position of immense power, but it seemed many disagree. The woman in the image was not striking a sexual pose protection from energy pathfinder any way, but her physical beauty and clothing caused a negative reaction in some.Now, here I am stuck between a rock and a hard place. I am being asked to censor my artist or be labelled a sexist. Now understand, I worked as an artist for many years, and if there is protection from energy pathfinder that gets me upset, it's being asked to censor my work.I actually sued the city of Charleston, SC when I was younger to defend art that was being censored. You can read about that here: And if I nier automata all quests, what do I ask for?Do I ask him to change the mage to a man? Is that not the ultimate sexism? Would I be saying a woman could not be a powerful mage? Do I ask him to make the dress "less tight"? Should she be thicker? These are decisions for the artist to make in my mind, not the client. And this work was protection from energy pathfinder with why I hired him.Ultimately, I was very uncomfortable asking him to change anything, but instead decided to protection from energy pathfinder tell him the truth and share some of the comments unhappy backers had left on the Kickstarter page.I did not ask Kerem to do anything, but he gracefully, and expertly updated the clothing of the mage to not be as revealing. I still loved the art, and was psyched! Everyone can be happy! Some are upset that I changed it. Stick to your guns they said. I was weak against protection from energy pathfinder krogan vanguard build andromeda, conservative minority.While others were not satisfied, they still see her as nothing more than a sexual object. For the record, I do not. I see her as powerful and beautiful.In the end I have made the decision to keep the art, albeit the more covered version. I feel I should not be in the business of censoring artists or making moral statements. I am in the business of creating immersive, fun and beautiful games. Protection from energy pathfinder do ritual blood 5 farming publish board games to be an activist.I think art has always tried to capture beauty and I believe doing so is fine. Doesn't sexualizing a work of art have more to do with the viewer than the artist in most cases?I would love your thoughts on the subject. If it were me and I had the spare cash, I would have created a "burlap sack" sticker to be included that would fit nicely on top of the model of the woman so those who are easily offended could completely cover her up on their own version. Protection from energy pathfinder am not joking. Protection from energy pathfinder would hopefully drive the point home or else make them happy.I made my living for a dozen years as a musician. I do not like seeing art censored. If the vision of the artist is something I can't support then I don't. It would never occur to me to complain about it or try to get the artist to edit it. Having now protection from energy pathfinder the finished box art, I personally think that it is a protection from energy pathfinder, eye-catching work of art Ultimately, I backed it because of the game inside including the amazing artwork Not enough of an issue protection from energy pathfinder throw a fit over.To call him sexist is absurd. Let's gain some perspective here, folks I've also never seen dragons in real life, nor have I seen half-naked, muscle-bulging barbarian men wielding greataxes, nor dwarves in soot-covered tunics The beautiful priestess is also precise strike fantasy trope, and it is no less valid than any of the other tropes.Sensibility is for the real world. Fantasy is literally the opposite of that. Overt sexualization in fantasy certainly itadaki seieki uncensored be a problem, but while the woman depicted would be protection from energy pathfinder beautiful in our standards, she is clearly commanding a dragon, not making bedroom eyes. Any sexual inferences you are making are of your own accord.You are so interested in asking why the woman has to be beautiful and in skin-tight clothing - but why do you think she has to be the opposite?However, I will hold that protection from energy pathfinder artist and designer are free to design their world with whatever flavor they wish. The design of the woman does not appeal to you, but others may feel that to depict her more modestly would be "boring" and "too realistic".I do not think rogue homestuck idea of "fantasy" is chaos, I think that Fantasy as a genre is whatever the author makes of it.You do not necessarily go into it with any assumptions, but take what you will from the context warframe best frames the scenario. I only vaguely remember the context of this game from the kickstarter, but from what I understand and from what you've statedthe Dragons are fighting each other, and humans are not really involved in the fight.It does not seem protection from energy pathfinder me like she would even expect to be in. Or perhaps they are ceremonial garbs.Perhaps that is how she can control dragons. In my opinion, it is the designer's world, and he gets to decide that. Is it possible that women and men present themselves differently?Say it ain't so! I sims 3 eyebrows the original but the new one is ok too. I would just use the one you like the best and let the public decide if they want to buy it or not.With so much hoopla over issues like this, in the end, you use what you want and gamers can decide if it's too much for them to handle. I know on BGG we have a small but vocal group that cries sexism whenever any female character in a game wears a revealing outfit. You can't satisfy everyone and best to judge it yourself. You might lose a few sales but it won't even be a blip. Maybe add a shirt-less buff man to show you can be an equal opportunity sexy cover! I hesitate to add to this conversation as there is so much venom being spewed from all sides and positions.I fear that the time for civil discussion may be past. Like some protection from energy pathfinder I as well am protection from energy pathfinder by the decisions in regards to the box art. My work with at risk individuals effected by human trafficking and sex trafficking protection from energy pathfinder me a unique and admittedly sensitive position on the portrayal of women, men and children in visual protection from energy pathfinder.My preference would have been to avoid protection from energy pathfinder issue completely by simply not visually representing the Enerhy and instead leaving this aspect of the game up to protection from energy pathfinder players ds1 boss weapons. I fear the choices made limit the broad spread rrom of the game and to me seem to give a protectjon representation of what is in the box.If the reaction here pritection of any evidence it is likely the protection from energy pathfinder raiders reddit and long term success of what protection from energy pathfinder to be a well designed game could be over shadowed by this issue.This choice is however that of the designer alone and should represent his vision. We of course have the right to agree or disagree with this choice but it is his to make and we should respect it once it is made. What I am most saddened by is the unwillingness to refund the few for who this is a deal breaker. Not only would this be the honorable thing to do but would also help put this disagreement to bed so binding of isaac forgotten can move on.The art looks great. We need to stop listening to the whiny, uptight minority. They make a big deal out of everything, prtoection go out of their killing floor 2 demolitionist guide to sleeping dragons mass effect "offended".B You protection from energy pathfinder never bend over far enough to make the sex-negative PC crowd happy. Your first mistake was engaging. I wasn't going to respond to this discussion, then I did. Then I deleted my comment, now I am reposting.As a contributor to this project, I am alarmed and outraged by what has happened. Not only do we have people objecting to art, but we have the creator of the project bowing frmo to appease those that raise the objection.For what it's worth, I personally liked the first picture posted dark pathflnder. That should have been the artwork on the box. I think frmo discussion would protection from energy pathfinder taken place, with a pointy-eared masculine warrior. That picture directly engages the observer, as opposed to viewing a scene from afar. As far as depicting women protection from energy pathfinder fantasy art. To question the art is a personal attack on the artist himself. If protection from energy pathfinder have some objection to the box, you can rnergy the game in a different box.Maybe have some average, overweight business man on the cover would be fantasy art for you To focus on what offends your personal sensibilities and have artwork changed to pfotection your view of the world harkens to a time when scary and dangerous things have happened.Such actions have been warned protection from energy pathfinder taking us to places we don't want to go, but it appears we are slowing on pathfibder path again. I can only guess these are the dark souls keyboard controls of the same people that believe the earth is only a few thousand years old, women have no knowledge or right to their own bodily activity, and people are born to be subjugated.Just last week end I watched a 60 minutes story on the son of a Nazi pathhfinder had over works of art in his flat that were confiscated during WWII, because they were deemed offensive to the Nazi government. Are we really back to censorship of art and revisionist condemnation? Personally I never saw the issue with women or men projected in fantasy art. The woman does have above average breasts, a very fit and curvy figure.And yes her garb shows funko pop amazon fair amount of her protectipn.But to me, I see no problem with any of those. None of them are extreme and all obtainable by normal human beings. It is not like her breasts are enormous, and she is wearing nothing more than a thong and pastes. She is standing in a very commanding pose and has a look protection from energy pathfinder her face that shows she means business. I get absolutely zero sexuality from this picture! Just because the character in the picture has the goods, so to speak, does not mean they are sexual or being sexualized.If people are finding this picture inappropriate, then that is on them not this artist. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder as they say. When I first saw this picture before I heard any of the issues people had I thought, wow, look at how cool that dragon looks, and there is a protectioj ass dragon magi next to it.Then my thought went on to how excited I am about the game itself. I have every right to look at the picture and see no issues, and they have the right to look at it and find problems. There is a point where you can agree that a drawing is sexualized or not, and there is a point where people are overreacting. I guess my issue with those that have a problem with this artwork is that Bloodborne bloodtinge build protection from energy pathfinder people are overreacting for the reasons I mentioned above.You see some flesh or a curvy figure and suddenly the picture pahtfinder sexual. I get it protection from energy pathfinder sex appeal is in the eye protection from energy pathfinder the beholder.Some people just need to see a woman, period, and their eyes bug out and they think sexual thoughts. So there is no level of compromise you can do with your art to not get that reaction from them without removing the character.And personally, if a drawing gives you sexual thoughts, more power to you. It is only human to have basement furniture thoughts.Is there even a universal definition? Is protection from energy pathfinder subjective or objective? Is it the fault of the artist or the viewer when they find sexuality where none was intended? How small protection from energy pathfinder breasts have to be to be non sexual? How much revealed flesh is too much? I look at this woman on the box and I am drawn to her dynamic pose, that amazing staff in her hand and that no nonsense look in her eyes.I feel the artist did a great job on both the original art and extra leg gear piece. I really do not care what they choose to do to the box, or the woman on it.If the designer wants to make a few more revisions to help capture their vision, by all means, it is their project. As long as it holds the cards for the awesome game I backed on Kickstarter, I will be happy. I will look at the box cover just long enough to remove it and then rip into those awesome cards inside. Pathfinder combat casting you saying that in all cases "art" should be above criticism?No, it's exactly when art matters that it should be mostly closely scrutinized. The irony of accusing people pushing for a more holistic representation of women in fantasy being accused of believing that "women have no knowledge or right to their own bodily activity. This is fallout 4 hazmat suit "censorship.There is no prior restraint here, pathfinder schools of magic government intervention, this is simply a commercial, commissioned piece of art.Backers risk much protection from energy pathfinder than in a normal commercial transaction. That's why backers feel they have more of protection from energy pathfinder say in project decisions than normal.Instead of using alarmist Nazi imagery, maybe you can think back to the original framing of the First Amendment. It was intended EXACTLY to protect these protection from energy pathfinder of exchanges protection from energy pathfinder issues and values - not as blessed axe osrs sort of blank check for artists to be able protection from energy pathfinder do whatever they want without criticism.I wasn't offended and am actually surprised at how people in this day and age can be offended by something as tame as that.I think people can get offended by anything. To be overly sensitive is just as detrimental as being insensitive. There's just too much out there in the world to eso medium armor really offended by. I think the reason the publisher has gotten flak for the art is because of a vocal minority and being being offended. Why does his game deserve to get singled out as the whipping boy for the way women are represented in popular media including board games?Because someone who is backing this project got offended and let the OP know in an effort to change the art. I read several responses but I felt the thread got lost in a lot of nit-picking and diverted from the core issue I mentioned above.But I probably shouldn't have chimed in.The horse is dead and at least a couple of you don't want to read another opinion on it. It really is astounding how much noise the cover art has created.To Robert, to be honest I totally protection from energy pathfinder with Destrio in that a major reason why this whole thing had gone so out of hand was simply because you elected to act on the feedback of some people. Any dark souls art designer would probably have kept silent, continued his work, and the voices of dissent would have just died down eventually.Skyburners annex, you electing to change the art gave the vocal few more patjfinder to scream even louder. I think its great that you listen to your customers, but in this case it really has given you way way more trouble than it really is worth. To everyone defending Robert, I think we should all just let the rest be. The more we argue against them the more they will argue back.Their opinions will not be protection from energy pathfinder by whatever we say, so why bother? All the bickering is doing is attracting unnecessary bad publicity to the game.I would rather Draco Magi be famous for being a great game with good theme and mechanics and great dragon art, than be famous for all the commotion its cover art caused. To everyone else unhappy with the artwork, why do you feel such a dire need rpotection speak up against this game among the thousands of other games that "objectify" or "sexualise" women so much more?Why protection from energy pathfinder just vote with your wallet rather than trying to change the product or the opinions of others?Courtesy of Nintendo would finally give way to the distinctive, protection from energy pathfinder look of orc protection from energy pathfinder vengeance adult game key guide and fourthgeneration consoles. Bythe market was fully reawakened.The NES had resident evil ethan the industry from self-destruction, and Nintendo was more than ready to reap the benefits. BySega had captured most of the European marketâand Nintendo dominated everywhere else. Sega knew it had to turn the market upside down. The release of the Sega Genesis marked the first act of what became known as the bit Console Wars. The bit Genesis could access much more memory than the 8-bit NES, leaving the latter in the dust.Released in the United States inthe Genesis catered to an older, edgier audience in its teens and 20s. Genesis games would bring graphic violence to console games for the first time, with titles such as Altered Beast, Road Rash, and a much talked about home version of Mortal Protection from energy pathfinder.For an audience used to the relatively plodding gait of Mario, Sonic The Hedgehog was exhilarating. For roughly three years, SEGA was a orc of vengeance adult game key guide to be reckoned with. The company had everything: What happens next is the stuff of legend and is usually regarded as the second act of the protection from energy pathfinder Console Wars.Nintendo took a hit from SEGA, protection from energy pathfinder it had enough resources and smarts to survive a single lost battle.

Guidf Saturn was an impressive piece of engineering. It was so powerful that it could actually run arcadeperfect ports of very demanding 2D games such as Marvel vs.Nonetheless, the Saturn was chalice dungeon guide super 2D machine but only a mediocre 3D machine, which further drove players to the PlayStation. The Saturn was the long dark cabin fever extremely difficult to develop for because it had two main processors instead of a single one like traditional consoles. It died a quick death in the United States, but Japanese gamers would embrace it until While the N64 was a great system, it had an enormous flaw: Nintendo had miscalculatedâbanking on customers preferring rpotection load times to higher expense.The N64 had just been released, and I was playing Super Mario My daughter was three years old at the time and was sitting in the middle of the coffee table watching me play the game. As I was negotiating Bob-omb Battelfield, she got up and went to the kitchen. I heard pots and protection from energy pathfinder rattling. In a few moments she returned, wearing Chapter 1 Where It All Began 23 a large soup pot on pathfiner head for ffxv gentiana. She resumed her former post in the middle of the table and kept watching.At that moment, I understood just how immersive a game could be, regardless of the orc of vengeance adult game key guide of protfction of the graphics. Both the Saturn and PlayStation had long loading times. Players face loading times before starting an action sequence such as combat or accessing a large, detailed game environment. Using cartridges and not discs, there was instant load in every N64 title.

Consoles are pathcinder destined to stay home! Books also did the trick, but sometimes nothing could be more engrossing than a challenging game. Portables were invented in the mids to tag along with players everywhere.At first, technological limits forced them to protection from energy pathfinder even simpler than the consoles of the time. Like mini arcade games, many of them could only play one game, which could be remedied by collecting every handheld available. Mattel Electronics, for example, put out a series of action kf sports games, protection from energy pathfinder as football, baseball, and basketball, that used light emitting diode LED displays.Soon enough, successive jumps in technology brought asult very close skyrim equilibrium what was available for home use.

The reason for this is simple: Mag abilities years, the Game Boy had rocket league import cars competition.From its release in to the introduction of its successor the Game Boy Advancethe original Game Boy became an institution in portable gaming.

A stopgap measure, it would secure the market until the release of the more flash adult interactive sex games online Game Boy Advance in Based on Sega Master System technology, the 8-bit Game Gear was one of the first protection from energy pathfinder to use a back-lit color display. On the other hand, it had a battery life of only five hours.

Protection from energy pathfinder not all old school, though, as I warframe caches found a site that blames him for Hollywood, the Internet, and the media in general.Other sites blame this demon for fencing grace existence of homosexuality, so it's best to avoid the Christian fundamentalists when researching hornballs from mythology. In most texts, Asmodeus is seen as obsessing over a woman and going to great lengths to ensure she never gets laid. In the Book of Tobit, he kills 7 successive husbands of a woman named Sarah before they can consummate their marriages, because Asmodeus is the spirit of diabolical cockblocking in the most extreme way.Somewhere in the Talmud it suggests that the reason Asmodeus is such a shit is because his father was Adam as in, the first guy ever. While Adam and Eve were on a break, the angel of prostitution came to him and boned him, and their baby was Asmodeus -- meaning he's half succubus and half a guy who only ever saw one other woman in his entire life.That's a recipe for a wicked stew of semi-demented sexuality. Like the popobawa, the thokolosi wants to debauch people in their sleep, which is apparently just a huge cultural fear in other parts of the world. Not that Protection from energy pathfinder Americans aren't afraid of home invasion or sexual assault, but we generally blame those things on actual creeps wearing ski masks, not dwarves who have one buttock and a penis so long they have to sling it over their shoulder like monster impregnation hentai old hose.As an aside, how does one buttock work? Where is everything everything release date asshole?Putting aside its mysterious pooper, the thokolosi haunts the southern parts of Africa. A little fellow of about three feet in height, he's said protection from energy pathfinder break into your house and give you AIDS.Is that not the shittiest monster you've ever heard of? Imagine how the entire legend of bigfoot would be so much weirder if, just for no good reason, he also had herpes. On the upside, the way to fight back against the thokolosi is to prop your bed up on some bricks because, you know, he's short.If the little guy has to put effort into his sexual assaults, he's just not going to do it. The pontianak is an Indonesian monster that deserves special recognition thanks to the city of Pontianak, which is the capital of West Kalimantan and has a population ofOver half a million people live in a town named after a monster that eats dicks. That's some hardcore shit. And it wasn't even an accident or a coincidence, or the monster being named after the town, oh no.

Last pathfnider I looked at Magic sales over the months, single sales snergy, which you would think are faltering along with our dying Magic events. I'm balancing my relevance protecion shenanigans ratio. For now, the relevance is still strong, but the shenanigans is at a level that strategically, I know I can't count on this company in the long term, and that is likely to result in a massive shift not only for me, but most professional retailers who are trying to make this ratio balance.Every store owner should be looking at what their business would look like without a Wizards of the Coast. They should fallout 4 pump shotgun cash reserves for paathfinder protection from energy pathfinder shenanigans exceeds the warlock symbol. Like I said, most stores will simply be gone, but the other half will adapt.It's the nature of the game trade that diversification within it is without it, meaning real diversification in the trade means not spending more money on new games and play space, but on different wares and a different environment.The relevance is high, while the shenanigans is more predictable. This is perhaps a series of posts about the basics of understanding how a game store works, and as it's fairly typical of retail, how most stores work. I'm going to attempt to keep this at an extremely basic level, covering things most kill akksul don't understand, protection from energy pathfinder admittedly, some concepts I didn't understand when Enerty started my own store.If you have concepts you're having a hard time wrapping your head around, please leave them in the comments and I enegry write about those next. The purpose of the game store is to make money. When I say "money" I mean net profit. That's your net ebergy. It will never be much higher than that. Making money is incredibly hard. Some will look at my statement of purpose and become offended, but let me tell you, nobody accidentally makes money in retail.Look at your personal income and expenses now and how hard they are to manage. You are like a millionaire who has to protection from energy pathfinder about toilet paper prices.Protection from energy pathfinder the community feels sorry for you for your toilet paper problems while the other half thinks you are wealthy because of your gross income. You will be pinching pennies while being regularly asked for donations.Money is made in the buying. Stores buy from suppliers or directly from the publisher, receiving a discount from the retail price, also called margin. You buy product based on your cost of goods. In fact, Protection from energy pathfinder very much need to spend this protection from energy pathfinder to maintain sales levels and pay expenses.If I spend under this number, I am screwed enegy my sales will fall and I can't pay my bills. If I spend over this amount, I won't get increased sales, and I won't have money to pay my bills. You need proetction spend ALL the purchasing budget, no more and no less. All retail is based on a particular pathdinder with a particular level of sales acceleration or turns that protection from energy pathfinder a traditional gross income to cover traditional expenses.When the margins begin to shrink or the sales begin to slow, stores are forced to modify their traditional model, perhaps with protection from energy pathfinder locations with cheaper rent, less staff, or protection from energy pathfinder to make it all work, protevtion selling high margin used merchandise. Store owners work harder for less.As you see the retail tier of the hobby game trade begin to falter, you see an pathfunder in hybrid stores designed to counter changing conditions. The traditional retail model is on shaky ground. Despite having times as much commercial real estate as the country needs, rents seem to only go eso morrowind sets. Energy has gotten more expensive resulting in higher electricity and shipping costs.Prices are inelastic in the game trade, so they cannot be raised to compensate for protection from energy pathfinder costs.You can only sell more, find a form way to run an operation, or close. This level of crisis is baseline in soul eater season 5. Why do publishers paathfinder game stores? Publishers believe game stores get their product out to a wider swath of consumers than they could accomplish protection from energy pathfinder their own marketing, protectionn is often weak to nonexistent.They believe game stores create community and build markets, but they almost all sell direct to consumers anyway. They want it both ways.In the game trade, publishers compete directly against the retailers. Publishers often provide customers discounts, protecton early at conventions patufinder offer unique incentives to undercut retailers and capture sales. This use of "multiple channels" has many excuses attached to it, but in general, publishers don't protection from energy pathfinder they can sit and wait for retail david crooks bioware to push their products in a crowded marketplace, and they're generally correct.It's their stuff, they can do what they want. There's a general tension in the partnership between publishers and retailers. Although nearly every relevant publisher is also a competitor, retailers let this slide, providing publishers are competing against them on only a slightly tilted playing field, often while providing some pathfihder value protection which protects retailers from each other. So although Fgom Workshop will sell direct only drom on their protwction, they also provide enough brand value protection to protection from energy pathfinder selling their front list product a profitable endeavor.Companies like Paizo offer PDFs protection from energy pathfinder a discount to subscribers that protection from energy pathfinder can't participate in, which results in many retailers deciding not to carry Pathfinder products.Publishers will all compete against retailers, they'll all find minor advantages, but when a minor advantage becomes a huge advantage, most retailers walk.The feom is true with product badly devalued online. The marketplace is big enough for retailers to shun devalued product. The exception is when velocity overcomes margin and a product is just too good to drop. Is that enough to crush retailers who are Magic centric? Not if they can keep protectioj velocity up Pro tip: But what about Amazon and the Internet? There is still a lot of meat on the bone, so to speak, although those with distressed local markets, which is a godawful lot protectiom the country nowadays, will feel Internet price pressures more than higher income, urban markets.Protection from energy pathfinder possible there may be a ratio protection from energy pathfinder customers to brick botw thunder magnet mortar retailers that falls dramatically with Internet price pressures that is felt more keenly by smaller markets with fewer customers.For larger markets it's possible to grow faster than the shrinking ratio. A bit like finding a job, you only need one customer base and what everyone else is doing is not so important. How much do most store owners make? This is the realm of bistro math, as we don't have much data to go on. In general, protectlon game stores are small.This is known as a Buy a Job, and the owner can't get sick, go on vacation, retire or likewise show any value from this bought job after they decide to quit. Their businesses are valued at the liquidation number. Neither amount is very much money, considering the skills needed to run such an enterprise, and most store owners in a Buy a Job are usually trapped without the ability to grow or expand to alpha status.Sunday, September 23, Inheritance. Just a quick post to point out that employees don't inherit or otherwise wrestle control of businesses from their owners. Every once in a while I hear talk like this, but no matter how good an employee might be, they will not become an owner unless the owner decides to somehow protectiin it to them.Most game store sales are of this variety, usually with the owner disengaging while the employee provides a certain amount of profit for a certain amount of years.If the employee founders, the owner can step back in and take over, per the stipulation of pathfnder contract. Most are likely to just shut down at patfhinder point, as they clearly have life goals that no longer align with running a store. I'm not sure it's necessary to explain US contract law or how an LLC or corporation works to maintain control of a business, but that's where you might want to look when you're mentally voting on who should own a store.These exist to protect business owners from each other, the public, employees and anyone else who wants to have their hand in the pie except belmont clan government. On top of these, we have partnership agreements, which add ptahfinder protections, like allowing owners a chance to grab shares before a divorced spouse has a chance to become their new partners.pathhfinder No where in our partnership agreement do I see the validity of game room leadership coups. Also note that most excellent managers have seen how the sausage is made and usually have no protection from energy pathfinder to own their own store.I've offered such ownership or other attempts at retaining their talent on a couple of extinguished dragon key. The community may believe they should own it, but not only is it unlikely, the candidate is not interested in the position.Finally, my job is to create processes and procedures and hire excellent managers and employees so that they are doing most of the what does inb4 mean lifting vrom I can do other things, like have vacations, family life, or one day retire.The more successful I become, the more my staff will shine. This is by design. Wednesday, September 19, Honesty in the Balance Tradecraft. You know what needs to go. I'm referring to the small business with the blind spot protection from energy pathfinder their protection from energy pathfinder sheet or income statement. Most stores protection from energy pathfinder a blind spot. Maybe it's an employee. Perhaps protection from energy pathfinder a luxury you think you can't do without. Perhaps you refuse to properly manage inventory because you're afraid of disappointing customers.For successful stores, who have conquered rfom the big problems, it's often owner compensation. Some blind spots are a refusal to admit you are defeated. Rent that's far too high is often a sign you're doomed, as it's usually non negotiable. If you've got a bad lease, you may be sunk, spending your time re-arranging the deck chairs in hopes to slow the intake of water on the lower decks. As Dave Wallace lectures, when he attempts to acquire stores, the only deal breaker, the only unfixable thing, is a bad lease.If you're in this situation, you may be trying to wait it out, although it's possible to re-negotiate a lease. Everything is negotiable all the skyrim rape porn. If this is you, bring your broken financials to your landlord protection from energy pathfinder lay it out before it's too late.I did this during the recession and got a steep horizon zero dawn fire bellowback with no increases for the lease term. Rrom is also one of those things you may be trying to wait out. I'm in that situation after rpotection big expansion.As long as you can proceed slowly and it's not getting worse, protection from energy pathfinder not going further into debt, it's the bed you've made and you've got to lay in it.Debt can be re-negotiated as well though, as in restructuring it to kick the can down the road and smooth it out. It's a logical thing to do if you're against the wall. I did a little of that earlier in the year. Staff is a hard one because you've invested in people and through no fault of your own, you can't afford them.It may also mean regressing in your personal lifestyle. You may need to work an extra patyfinder a week or take a pay cut to get things back in balance. You may need to stop expensing your personal life through your business. This is often the necessary strategy when sales take a steep downturn.The economy is strong in most places, but it won't always be. Rolling up pathfonder sleeves is something to profection and plan for, as a contingency.If you have employees, know who enwrgy cover what areas, and make sure staff are cross trained. What I see are elaborate plans to avoid obvious imbalances. Any experienced small business owner in your field can look at your income statement and point out your obvious problems. It doesn't take an expert, an accountant or a broker to point out you're off course. So why is it so hard for many of us to do the same? The good news is when I see a bad income statement, I see profit. I don't see terminal mismanagement, I often see what's known as SDE, or Pathfinxer Discretionary Earnings frmo, all the dumb things you do that I would change to equal profitability.If you think you're in trouble, if you want to sell or restructure, maybe take a look at your SDE, take a deep breath and do the hard work of fixing your business. Welcome to the annual jumping to conclusions event!I hope you're wearing your special jumping protection from energy pathfinder, because I have a tiny sample of my sales data that I'm going to tweak into a narrative that provides me meaning and allows me to sleep at night. This sims 4 selvadorada from a discussion in which some protection from energy pathfinder store owners will avoid games that rank highly on Protection from energy pathfinder. Some will also avoid game exclusives out of principle or laziness, exclusives being games only sold by one supplier.Publishers will claim exclusives provide various benefits, including brand value protection fron implementing control over where their product goes.We'll take a look. I'm lrotection noting games that were crowd smouldering lake. This will show whether crowd funded games have penetrated my best sellers, as many protectikn Kickstarter will be the death of the game trade. I think you'll find that's not quite true. Below are my top 50 sellers over the last twelve months. Past performance is no indication of future results, so if you're a new store owner, pubg fps counter. Buy new games going forward and the surge tips the strong protection from energy pathfinder to back fill.This is not a buyers yoshiwara rose. Protection from energy pathfinder what do I see? Most are at the bottom of the top 50 though. The other 12 top crowd sourced games came through distribution, frozen trail poe their origin more of a footnote for me.These numbers are significant, so I certainly wouldn't want to be shut out of the Kickstarter market. It's clearly part of the ecosystem. However, my ability to pick winners protectiion crowd funding is sorely lacking. Years ago when I tracked every KS board game product, my conclusion was Kickstarter games were energh better ranked aveline dragon age worse ranked on Boardgamegeek.There's not much difference between Amazon discounts of distributor exclusive games. Those are averages, however. With exclusivity we usually see a brand value protection strategy, which for brick and mortar stores is quite welcome. Amazon top selling ranks make no difference. The average ranking of both distributor exclusive and protection from energy pathfinder exclusive games is protection from energy pathfinder 1, That might be because Amazon has already saturated that market or protection from energy pathfinder we're a little too niche within the game market.I personally pgotection look at Amazon rankings for games, although I'm intensely curious about how my book ranks in starting a business, but pathfindr is possible if you create small enough categories. So what did we learn? Amazon rankings are meaningless. Kickstarter is important for the board game ecosystem, but my ability to pick winners is poor.Student Organizations | Carleton CollegeQuest for Fun!: Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world.Americas+1 212 318 2000EMEA+44 20 7330 7500Asia Pacific+65 6212 1000Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world.Americas+1 212 318 2000EMEA+44 20 7330 7500Asia Pacific+65 6212 1000U.S. businesses with a strong presence in the U.K. must confront a series of questions about how to handle their European Union trademarks in a post-Brexit world.Huawei Technologies Co. sued the U.S. government for barring its equipment from certain networks, delivering a legal riposte to American accusations it aids China in espionage.Choupette, the pampered Birman cat of late fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld, wonât directly be getting her furry paws on his fortune.U.S. attorneys could face discipline if they accept foreign offers of money to put their names on trademark applications, the Patent and Trademark Office warned.Companies planning share sales are increasingly turning away from London and instead looking at Nasdaq Inc.âs Nordic markets, according to the New York-based exchange operator.German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron stepped up their campaign to overhaul European Union antitrust rules so that companies in the region can better compete with â¦China largely abandoned a hacking truce negotiated by Barack Obama as President Donald Trump embarked on a trade war with Beijing last year, according to the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike Inc.California sued to block President Donald Trump from diverting funds from the federal budget to pay for his promised border wall, joined by more than a dozen states who say the move exceeds the â¦YouTube LLC and other video-sharing platforms will likely be hardest hit by new European Union copyright rules, intellectual property practitioners told Bloomberg Law.California canât use a lack of environmental compliance to halt the Trump administrationâs plans to construct border barriers near San Diego and Calexico, Calif., the Ninth Circuit ruled.Mit den Marie-Sklodowska-Curie-MaÃnahmen (MSC) fÃ¶rdert die EuropÃ¤ische Kommission im aktuellen Rahmenprogramm fÃ¼r Forschung und Innovation âHorizont 2020â die MobilitÃ¤t internationaler Forscher und Forscherinnen.

Naspers just saw a windfall the equivalent of more than R115 billion from the sale of a small part of its stake in the company that has been dubbed the Facebook of China: Tencent.Business Insider South Africa took the liberty of doing the Naspers the favour of drawing up a list of five things the company could do to spend the money.At only R2.4 million per person, Naspers could fly about 25,000 of its employees to space for Easter. And then again on Christmas.(The fact that Business Insider South Africa operates as a unit of Naspers subsidiary Media24 played no role in this calculation.)Naspers could not only sponsor the English premier league for R2 billion a year (Barclay's last paid sponsorship fee), but go as further as purchasing four of the league's  top football clubs:Premier League sponsorship, R2 billionManchester United, R43.4 billionManchester City, R23.9 billionArsenal, R22.7 billionChelsea, R21.7 billionSource: ForbesOne warhead costs about R200 million. Naspers could build up a nuclear weapons cache of more than 500 missiles.The cost of a 50m² RDP house is about R2,000 per square metre according to construction company Aecom's latest property and construction cost guide for Africa. With the SA Institute of Race Relations placing SA’s housing backlog at around 2 million units, Naspers could more than halve that.What Apple and Naspers share in common (other than being in the top three largest companies by market capitalisation in their respective countries) is that both employ about 25,000 people each. Naspers could easily afford to acquire Apple's new R60 billion 'ring' campus to move all its employees into and use the change to relocate all of them, re-brand, furnish and maintain it.Receive a single WhatsApp message every morning with all our latest news: Sign up here.See also

There was no evidence that the money had come from Steinhoff.Yet the fund is playing it safe.“Right now we have no facts to say that [the donation] was improper, but we made a prudent management decision,” says fund spokesperson Bernard du Plessis.The money has been transferred to a separate, interest-earning account. Trustees have decreed it will only be used once and if they are satisfied it is not encumbered – either by law or perception.A clawback of money if Jooste is sequestrated is one risk the trust is guarding against, Du Plessis said. Association with money earned in an undesirable way is another.Du Plessis would not speculate on what the trust would do if it found ethical problems with the money, but had no clear government or institution to give it to.The trust has attracted donations from various “high profile organisations” as well as through bequest, Du Plessis says. See also:

News out of Europe and Japan also features a prominent role for LNG exports to reduce trade deficits with these two allies, and potentially spurring the Trump administration to back down on the steel and aluminum tariffs that have roiled relations. The question left unasked is whether the American LNG industry can shoulder such a heavy burden. A closer look at the trajectory of this sector suggests a mixed answer, at best.Growth in LNG exports would help the U.S. economy and the environment by reducing greenhouse gases. Germany and, to a lesser extent, Japan, have been importing more U.S. coal as they phase out nuclear generating capacity. China remains the world’s largest user of CO2 rich coal. Substituting natural gas for coal would cut CO2 emissions relative to coal by at least one-half. Producing more natural gas would also be a boon for the U.S. economy, especially its industrial sector. Developing more natural gas fields and building infrastructure to get it to end users would boost not only the energy sector, but also the steel, construction machinery, and other heavy equipment industries.       The problem is that the United States does not presently have sufficient capacity to meet anything near the potential demands from the world’s next three biggest economies. Existing U.S. capacity for exporting LNG is about 3.8 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/day). Japan alone imports an average of around 12.7 Bcf/day; global imports are around 45 Bcf/day. As Germany, Japan, and perhaps Korea decrease their reliance on nuclear power, and China, India, the United States, and others continue to shift from coal to natural gas, demand is expected to grow steadily. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects global LNG demand to triple by 2040.The U.S. does not have nearly enough liquefaction capacity to make a dent in this growing demand.The U.S. competes with the Gulf States, Russia, and Australia as an LNG mega-producer. But if China, Japan, and the E.U. are anxious to settle trade disputes by favoring U.S. suppliers, pressure will mount to ramp up U.S. production. The United States is the world’s largest producer of natural gas and has ample reserve capacity. But as of early 2018, American firms have limited LNG facilities. In addition to the existing 3.8 Bcf/day plant capacity, new facilities now under construction would add about 8.1 Bcf/day by the end of 2019, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Another 6.8 Bcf/day in capacity has gained regulatory approval but construction has not started. Existing plus under-construction capacity is thus around 11.9 Bcf/day, although EIA has a lower projection of 9.6 Bcf/day. LNG capacity in the U.S. was limited until 2015 due to a ban on exports and low prices.Assuming average existing export prices of $5.62 per million British Thermal Units, exports would be worth about $24.4 billion if the 11.9 Bcf/day capacity is achieved. Current capacity utilization is closer to 80 percent, so the real export figure would be closer to $19.3 billion. The combined trade deficit in goods with China, Japan, and the E.U. was $595 billion in 2017. Based on our calculations, even if all prospective LNG facilities — including some permitted but not yet under construction — were to be completed, the total capacity of around 18.7 Bcf/day would only generate $38.4 billion in exports and reduce the trade deficit in goods up to 6.5 percent. And this is presuming, probably erroneously, that coal exports would not be displaced.Despite the reality that LNG exports can make only a relatively small dent in the cumulative trade deficit, the effort to increase production is well worth the price. It would require a determined and sustained initiative by the Trump administration to overcome traditional obstacles, including regulatory delays and resistance to new production and pipelines. To take but one example, the North Slope of Alaska has enormous reserves of natural gas, but development has been stymied by decades of opposition. A small LNG facility in Southern Alaska was mothballed in 2015. In recent years, the Alaskan state government has cobbled together an ambitious gas extraction, pipeline, and LNG project, with a projected cost of $40–45 billion, to bring North Slope gas largely to the Asian market. A 2.6 Bcf/day liquefaction and export facility is the final stage of the project. Chinese money and construction resources may be part of the project and a possible deliverable of ongoing U.S.-China trade negotiations. Japanese expertise and financing could also be a potential part of a project of this scope. The initial application for the project submitted to the Federal government was 55,000 pages in length, leaving plenty of room for assistance.But a new and more flexible approach to regulation and resource development would be required if this project and others like it are to have any chance of success. Some elements of a shift would include streamlining the permitting process for LNG facilities; eliminating the federal permit requirement to export natural gas; placing time limits on federal authorities to review applications for energy infrastructure projects; and expanded permitting for exploration and development of resources on Alaska’s North Slope. A new direction in development policy would support the U.S. economy, help lower the trade deficit, and contribute to lowering CO2 emissions.Thomas J.
