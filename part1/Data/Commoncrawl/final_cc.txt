This incident happened over a closed room meeting today. But then despite the odds US Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts was reported to be voting in favor of the spending compromise which are being negotiated by President Obama and the congressional republics.The deal is going to extend the tax cut implemented during the Bush era. Many of the Democrats have for a long time opposed the extension of subsidized rate for the family with a monthly income of $250,000 it was insisted by the republicans that the taxes must not be raised on a weak economy such as this. John Kerry saidI oppose extending the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy and have voted against them since day one, every time in between, and opposed them when I ran for president,But the unavoidable reality remains that week after week, vote after vote, Senate Republicans marched in lockstep to hold middle class tax cuts and unemployment insurance hostage to bonus tax cuts only for the wealthiest AmericansKerry mentioned that he was acting on the behalf of the laid off workers who were facing lesser benefits.

Hall & Lieberman (2001) define monopoly as
			a market where only one provider of goods or services exists without close substitutes. The authors further define
			market as "a group of buyers and sellers with the potential to trade". In the example of a Cable TV provider,
			the economy in which the monopoly exists is circumscribed by the boundaries of the governmental institution that
			authorized it - this can be city, county or statewide. In the case of global monopolies like the Organization of
			Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the market is global. However, monopoly markets are not necessarily confined
			by geography but instead by barriers like economies of scale, control of scarce inputs and government regulation.
			From analysis of these definitions I conclude that the effect of changes in global economy is proportional to the
			extent in which a monopoly extends through the global economy in terms of its inputs, processes and outputs.

			For example, Malpass in National Review Online describes the breakdown of OPEC's monopoly as "due in part,
			to Russia's growing relationship with the Bush administration." Malpass goes on to say that because of the
			growing relationship between the US and the Soviet Union, "the economic importance of Saudi Arabia and the
			Arab oil producers" was materially diminished in simple words, Arab countries were no longer in control of
			"scarce inputs" or oil. In this case, the change in relationship between two countries, the US and Soviet
			Union (a change of global economic reaching proportions) affect a global monopoly.

			Now let's take a look at what happens in Smallville USA as a direct result. The local hotel or cable television
			provided may not be impacted drastically by the events affecting OPEC, in fact the price of gasoline may be so
			small that these two monopolies may not be affected at all. Now let's think about the small gas station in town
			- you know, the one cited in the book as a monopoly which becomes a monopoly simply because of economy of scale.
			Here, another service station would have to beat the price of gas and win over the clients in order to make a profit.
			However, because the inputs to the gas station consist of refined oil products, the cost of gas may have an indirect
			impact on its level of profit. This change in global economy's effect is due to the fact that the gas station's
			(our little monopoly) input comes from the affected global oil market.

By James Hamilton Britain within the 19th century observed a chain of technological and social adjustments which proceed to steer and direct us this present day. Its reactants have been human genius, cash and impression, its crucibles the streets and associations, its catalyst time, its keep an eye on the market.In this wealthy and engaging publication, James Hamilton investigates the colourful trade among tradition and company in nineteenth-century Britain, which grew to become a centre for international trade following the economic revolution. He explores how paintings used to be made and paid for, the turns of style, and the recent calls for of a transforming into middle-class, widespread between whom have been the artists themselves.While top figures corresponding to Turner, Constable, Landseer, Coleridge, Wordsworth and Dickens are gamers the following, so too are the shoppers, financiers, creditors and industrialists; attorneys, publishers, marketers and newshounds; artists' providers, engravers, purchasers and curators; hostesses, shopkeepers and brothel keepers; quacks, charlatans and auctioneers.Hamilton brings all of them vividly to existence during this kaleidoscopic portrait of the enterprise of tradition in nineteenth-century Britain, and gives exciting and unique insights into the operating lives of a few of our so much celebrated artists.

Read or Download A Strange Business: Making Art and Money in Nineteenth-Century Britain PDFBest history booksHearts Touched by Fire: The Best of Battles and Leaders of the Civil War In July 1883, quite a few days after the 20th anniversary of the conflict of Gettysburg, a gaggle of editors on the Century journal engaged in a full of life argument: Which Civil battle conflict used to be the bloodiest conflict of all of them? One claimed it was once Chickamauga, one other chilly Harbor. The argument encouraged a brainstorm: Why no longer enable the magazine’s 125,000 readers in at the dialog by way of supplying “a sequence of papers on a number of the nice battles of the struggle to be written through officials in command on either side.
Legends, Monsters, or Serial Murderers?: The Real Story Behind an Ancient CrimeThe majority of serial homicide stories aid the consensus that serial homicide is largely an American crime—a mistaken assumption, because the usa has existed for only 250 years. what's way more most likely is that the perverse urge to continually and deliberately kill has existed all through human background, and sizeable percent of serial murders all through precedent days, the center a while, and the pre-modern period have been attributed to innovative surrogate factors: dragons, demons, vampires, werewolves, and witches.Legends, Monsters, or Serial Murderers? the genuine tale in the back of an old Crime dispels the interrelated misconceptions that serial homicide is an American crime and a comparatively contemporary phenomenon, making the unconventional argument that serial homicide is a old reality—an unrecognized truth in precedent days. famous serial murderers reminiscent of the Roman Locuta (The Poisoner); Gilles De Rais of France, a prolific serial killer of kids; Andres Bichel of Bavaria; and chinese language aristocratic serial killer T'zu-Hsi are spotlighted. This e-book presents a different viewpoint that integrates supernatural interpretations of serial killing with the heritage of actual crime, reanimating mythic entities of horror tales and offering them as genuine criminals.Book Description
When requested to call a serial assassin, most folk are inclined to contemplate American criminals who won notoriety within the twentieth century, equivalent to David Berkowitz, Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy, or Richard Ramírez. in spite of the fact that, serial homicide is neither a contemporary crime nor one basically dedicated within the United States.About the Author
Dirk C. Gibson is affiliate professor of verbal exchange and journalism on the college of latest Mexico, Albuquerque, NM. His released works contain Praeger's Serial Killing for revenue: a number of homicide for funds; Serial homicide and Media Circuses; and Clues from Killers: Serial homicide and Crime Scene Messages.---

Extra info for A Strange Business: Making Art and Money in Nineteenth-Century BritainExample textAt a more practical level, because the undergraduate experience inspires unusual loyalty among its alumni, the existence of a college makes possible much of the philanthropy to build the facilities, create the extensive libraries, and endow the professorships that allow the university to produce first-Â­rate research.  Economic development and research also complement one another.  A university is in the best position to know of discoveries in its laboratories that can 32ââ¢âChapter Two be turned into useful products and processes. Of the nine colleges founded before the American Revolution, six were still ranked in the top dozen in 2010, and all nine fit comfortably within the top one hundred.  Similarly, while few of the leading corporations from a century ago continue to be successful, or even to exist, the top five universities in 1910 were still ranked among the top five in 2010, and at least two-Â­thirds of the top twenty retained that distinction a century later.  Once a university has obtained a lofty position in the hierarchy, powerful forces help to keep it there. As research and education have come to be looked upon as vital ingredients of economic growth, countries with highly developed, knowledge-Â­based economies are all being driven by a common desire to strengthen their universities.  In doing so, most have been influenced by the success of the American system and have consciously attempted to adopt many of its features.  17 To attract more students from other parts of the world, a number of departments and even a few entire universities in Europe and elsewhere are now teaching all or many of their courses in English.

						You know what you want your business to look like. You just don't know how to get from idea to implementation.You're either:You're willing to do the work. But you don't have time or energy to waste on learning and implementing new strategies if they won't move you towards your big goals.You're determined to hit your revenue goals. But not if it means sacrificing your health, freedom, or time with your loved ones.And you're motivated to build your business. But sometimes you need others to give you a push, call you on your excuses, or remind you that you've GOT this.Between home life, your current workload and social obligations, you can't seem to find the time to do it all while also learning the new software and skills to grow your business. Fraudy feelings make you want to hide behind your computer screen. You lack the confidence to commit to any decision, because what if you fail or waste your money and time on the wrong things?You want a reliable process for getting the "yes!" that doesn't feel pushy, so you can sell with integrity, get more of the RIGHT clients, and shake your moneymaker while standing by your values.You lose steam when it's time to implement ideas. You know if you focused on THE ONE THING that would generate the most money for as long as it took to plan and execute it, you'd scale faster.You work outside your zone of genius because you struggle to give up control. You hold yourself back because you go it alone. But if you had accountability, you know you'd accomplish more.I had (get this) no food in the fridge but a family to feed, $100,000 of debt, and one cricut machine that was my final hope.I sold it, made $120, and was able to buy groceries and put gas in my car.But I knew if my life was going to change for good, my business habits and mindset had to change too . . .If I was playing at the level of a $30k small business owner, how could I ever expect to create the reality of a 6-figure one?So I swallowed my pride and asked my mom to borrow money for a coach as a last ditch effort to get my business back on track. I saw a 400% return on that investment, but better yet, I found the confidence and clarity I needed to get my business moving.For years, I'd been trying to solve the growth puzzle. To figure out what separates successful entrepreneurs who get traction from the ones who stay stuck at the same income level, year after year.And you know what I was shocked to realized?It's rarely a lack of time, tight funds or slow Internet connection that's holding us back from going after what we want. It's our lack of self-belief, direction and accountability.Working day in and day out or being a relentless overachiever is not going to help you succeed in business if you don't believe that you CAN . . . or deserve to.No matter what you want to achieve in your business, if you've got underlying fraudy feelings that tell you a) you can't have what you want or b) those who have it are "the lucky few" who are smarter and have more free time and disposable income than you do or c) if you get it, you won't be able to handle the added responsibility . . .You'll never take the steps to level up.And this is why to this day, I believe that business coaching had the biggest impact on my business and saved me from scraping by for another 5 years. (Or quitting altogether.)We take months fiddling with website layouts or putting sticky notes on calendars and pushing them back every other week.We spend hours chasing the squirrels in our head, learning everything from Facebook ads to graphic design just to avoid paying a pro to do it. We keep trying new social media trends and marketing tactics, looking for the magic pill to solve all our problems.And all that does? Is distract us from our dreams and give us more gray hairs.By the time we show up at the business party, everyone's either gone home, we aren't as excited about our ideas anymore, or someone else is already showing off the thing we thought of months ago but were waiting to "get perfect".What if you were proactive about your goals, instead of thinking you're stuck in the same place you were last year and there's nothing you can do about it?What if you could live a fun-filled life while achieving your personal best in business?And what if you could wake up one day and be running the profitable, freedom-based business you used to be jealous of?Think about what would be possible if you knew exactly what growth strategies to focus on in your business and how to consistently execute on them.You could be the business powerhouse you hoped you'd be one day . . . in as little as 90 days.It's about believing in what's possible for you.That might be writing the damn book already to prove to yourself that you CAN follow through on your commitments . . .Creating a sustainable business model that lets you check out when your health isn't cooperating or family stuff comes up . . .Or simply having a clearer business vision and knowing what your business stands for.For me, it's making over six figures and contributing financially around my house so we can take advantage of more opportunities.It's working from home as a business coach and traveling all over the world as a keynote speaker.It's being able to take my family on a ski vacation or pick my kids up from school when they're sick. It's spending my days supporting amazing women all over the world who are grabbing their business by the horns and seizing big opportunities. (And sometimes, it's running masterminds that are too fun to be called "work".)I'm living proof that if you have goals for your business—even if you think they're out of your reach—don't wait until you can afford a custom website, break $100k, or your kids are in college to go after them.Start right now. Be a #WomanofAction.Maybe you're in the early startup phase and don't even know where to start. Maybe your business is growing, but at a snail's pace. Or maybe you're trying to bring your offline business into the (crazy intimidating) online space.Wherever you're at, the only REAL thing standing in your way of creating the business you deserve is having the right strategy, expert guidance to help you implement it, and a community of highly motivated women to hold you accountable.Content Creator | Curator | Social-ite, Carrots & PeaceIt's a 3-month online group coaching program and implementation hub for service-based women entrepreneurs like you who are tired of guessing their way to success (and doing it alone).It's a proven, step-by-step system for accomplishing your next-level goals in 90 days without losing the fun in the process.And it's the kick in the butt you need to actually get your next steps ACCOMPLISHED.If you need a big picture plan that chunks down your goals into small, doable tasks that are easier to follow and commit to . . .So you can find better ways to manage your time and energy, by focusing on the strategies that'll get you the biggest results in the least amount of time . . .And you want to do it alongside other super savvy women you can connect with, learn from and grow with . . .This practical, easy-to-implement program will show you how to get where you want to go in your business AND give you the expert guidance and community support to get there.Not only will you walk away with a solid plan for sustainable business growth, including step-by-step strategies that can be customized to meet you where you're at . . .But you'll also tap into a network of accountability partners and business besties who will be there to help you follow through and 10x the power of your efforts.This is more than a how-to training course. It's an implementation and accountability strategy.I saw a need to create an affordable and accessible crossover between peer accountability and coaching after seeing SO many business owners slip through the cracks of online courses.Self-study business programs don't work because you don't get the guidance or support you need to progress. And even when programs offer group coaching calls, it's impossible to deliver personalized feedback when you're responsible for teaching a large group.That's why I wanted Electrify to be unlike any other business coaching program out there. A blend of masterminding, coaching and accountability. A program that focused on the DOING, not just the learning. Because knowing your next steps is one thing. Actually taking them? That's where most programs fall short and Electrify Your Business steps in.MAKE REAL PROGRESS WITH SMALL ACCOUNTABILITY GROUPS
						With most online courses, you can disappear into the crowd and fall into your typical "I'll do that later" habits. Not in Electrify. Intimate accountability groups encourage engagement and give you a chance to mastermind at a highly personal level, so you move towards your big goals faster.GET TIME TO IMPLEMENT WHAT YOU LEARN AND TROUBLESHOOT CHALLENGES
  If you don't get time to implement while you learn, it's easy to get behind or lose your chance to get feedback because you haven't done the work.

New Delhi, Aug 31 (IANS) Alarmed by the sealing and demolitions of unauthorised buildings in the Indian capital, top retailers are shifting to upcoming malls, leading to a sharp rise in property prices and rentals.

As the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), pushed by a Supreme Court order, prepares to seal over 45,000 commercial buildings operating in residential areas, a good number of fashion designers are preparing to shift out of their existing business locations.


'We have paid three times the price to find a suitable place in a mall after we had to vacate our shops because of the demolitions,' said Abhinav Sharma, a leading name in fashion design.


Sharma had a showroom in MG-I on the Delhi-Guragon road, the hub of fashion stores that was demolished by MCD in February.


Earlier, he used to pay around Rs.60,000 a month as rent for the MG-I showroom but now has to shell out around Rs.200,000.


'The prices have gone up because there are not many good places where designers can start a showroom, so we are being charged hefty prices for the space,' he said.


Taking note of the demand for high-standard malls, especially after the continued sealing and demolitions, real estate developers like the DLF Group are constructing swanky malls along the Delhi-Gurgaon road, which could see a second life as the fashion destination of Delhi.


'We are constructing a mall on the MG road as it was the centre of Delhi's fashion industry. Though the mall is under construction people have booked space at a rate of Rs.175 per square foot,' said a DLF manager who did not want to be named.


Agreeing that property prices have gone up steeply in the capital, mall developers say the trend would continue for a while.


'We are charging Rs.150 per square foot area for rent and Rs.500,000 per square foot in case of lease,' said Aarti, senior manager of East Delhi Mall.


On their part, MCD officials are preparing to start the process of re-sealing and demolition once again.


'Talks have been going on with Delhi Police as we suspect people might try to interfere in our work,' said one MCD official.


The process had been stopped in May after the central government enacted the Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Act seeking to halt the demolition and sealing drives in the national capital.


However, the Supreme Court Aug 10 ordered the resumption of the drive.


The court stayed the urban development ministry's notification that directed de-sealing of the sealed premises and allowed those that had given an undertaking to stop the commercial activity by June 30 to continue it beyond that day.


The sealing drive had been undertaken following an order of the court to put a stop to the misuse of residential properties for commercial purposes.

    by Bill Keller
    published by Times Books.
    © 2003 by Bill KellerFrom Publishers Weekly
          The topography of class in America has shifted over the past twenty 
          years, blurring the lines between upper, middle and lower classes; some 
          have argued that the concept of class is irrelevant in today's society. 
          While the 14 pieces in this volume (all originally printed as part of 
          a New York Times series) shed light on a different aspect of class, 
          they all agree that it remains an important facet of contemporary American 
          culture and draw their strength by examining class less through argument 
          than through storytelling. The reader, by following three heart attack 
          victims through very different recoveries, by witnessing the divergent 
          immigrant experiences of a Greek diner owner and his Mexican line cook, 
          by tracing the life path of an Appalachian foster child turned lawyer 
          and a single welfare mother turned registered nurse, or by seeing the 
          world from the perspective of the wife of a "relo" (a six-figure 
          executive who relocates every few years to climb the corporate ladder), 
          quickly realizes class is defined by much more than income. The collection 
          has the power of a great documentary film: it captures the lives and 
          ideas of its subjects in lively, articulate prose that, while grounded 
          in statistics and research, remains engaging and readable throughout. 
          The result is neither an attack on the rich nor a lecture to the poor, 
          but a thoughtful consideration of class dynamics. Its empathetic take 
          on this divisive subject and straightforward prose style will make the 
          book of interest to a wide range of readers. Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier

E-business is everywhere. Most newspapers and magazines carry articles about the hottest new idea for conducting commerce over the Internet. But what is the truth behind the e-business world? How does it operate? How and why does a business go on-line?As e-commerce increasingly creeps into all facets of everyday life we need to understand how e-business evolved, the technologies and business models that drive it, the threat it poses to traditional business models, and how it is likely to grow in the future. In this course  we aim to provide an answer to these questions and to develop a fuller understanding of e-business opportunities.I would like to study Business Management at university, as I am interested in current affairs and am curious about the real worldBusiness management will teach and help me how to manage people; how to make and carry out decisions; and how to assess markets. It is a broad subject, which will develop my ability to think logically and creativelyThe subjects I am studying at A-level will be relevant to Business Management as Economics is mainly a written subject where accurate use of English is essential. Memorizing economic concepts are crucial in understanding the environment in which businesses operate; it also helps to improve your memory. Learning different market structures such as monopoly and perfect competition is important and in Business Management my knowledge will be further broadened. Economics is a strong A-level subject- most professional careers demand a course in economics as part of training. To run a business we must be aware of the economyI enjoy studying law as it has widened my scope on problems in our society. It has taught me how the law is made, enforced and how it affects us. I have developed skills of research, analytical and problem solving skills, I also have the ability to select relevant legal authority and evidence, for example, relevant cases and statutes. Law is crucial for businesses as it guides you on what you can and cannot do. E.U Law is crucial as in 1989, a 'Charter of Fundamental Social Rights for Workers' was adopted by 11 of the then 12 Member States of the European Union. Many initiatives on improving the working conditions of E.U citizens were out forward. Employment rights such as health and safety protection; protection of pregnant women; the right to annual paid holidays and improved social and professional integration for the disabled are essential if a business is to succeedFrom sociology, I have learnt the theories and views of well-known sociologists such as Karl Marx and many others. I carried out a research report on a piece of sociological research and have written a challenging essay of two thousand words. Sociology has helped me to develop skills of research, analysing evidence and theory, dealing with competing arguments in written and oral reports. Sociology is relevant to many areas of management such as Personnel Management, which deals with issues of unfair dismissal that could be due to gender or race, for exampleI am interested in reading, films and music. I have been to the theatre and I enjoyed the experience. I like to keep in touch with what news is making the headlines and therefore try to read newspapers when I canI like to show creativity by cooking and designing decorative henna patterns for use on the handsI hope to gain knowledge of Business Management and for studying at university to provide me with a starting point in my career.                       Article by TSR User on Thursday 15 February 2018                                         I have always been a very determined, proactive, hardworking and ambitious person. I am very interested in business and inspired by entrepreneurs who have made a success of their businesses e.g. Peter Jones. I have enjoyed my college course and this is why I want to study business at University.My BTEC National Diploma in Business course at college has been very interesting and helpful. I have learnt a lot about how businesses run and specifically the different areas of business including marketing research, relationship marketing, human resources and administration. Also, I have learned many new skills for example being able to research and learn independently and being able to work towards deadlines with my assignments. I have consistently achieved distinctions in my assignments and am on track to getting a distinction for my final grade.I feel I want to go to university because it will help me expand my skills and gain a lot of knowledge that will help me in life when looking for a career. I also feel that studying at university will allow me to demonstrate my strong hard-working ethic and take on new experiences.Since September 2007, I have been working part time for Tesco. This has provided me with an opportunity to work as part of a team co-operating with others but at the same time also working independently. I have been able to learn new skills, for example being able to deal with the public and use my own initiative. Also I think working at a big company has given me an insight into how a large business operates. I am always very organised and prepared and have good time keeping record. These qualities have been reflected in the fact that I have had good reports from my managers and have met my targets. I have always been conscientious, not only at Tesco but in similar jobs at Homebase and Asda.I was a prefect and a peer mentor at school, which reflects the fact that I am reliable and have good interpersonal skills. My interests include playing and watching sports especially football. Also I like to see my friends and regularly go to the cinema. I am currently learning to drive.I am a reliable, motivated and organised student, who enjoys experiencing new challenges and always gives their all. I am looking forward to the experience and challenges of university life.

If you are not sure about either the area or the category leave the choice to "Display All". You have to specify only one of "Category" or "Region".Durch den Businessplan bereiten Sie sich optimal auf Ihre GrÃ¼ndung vor. Damit vermeiden Sie einen der hÃ¤ufigsten GrÃ¼nde fÃ¼r ein vorzeitiges Scheitern Ihres Businessplans: mangelnde Planung. Sie erstellen den Businessplan fÃ¼r sich selbst, aber auch fÃ¼r Banken und Investoren, um das notwendige Kapital fÃ¼r Ihre UnternehmensgrÃ¼ndung zu erhalten. Mit dem Businessplan legen Sie den Grundstein fÃ¼r Ihre Stiftung. Das kostenlose Businessplan-Tool ermÃ¶glicht es Ihnen, einfach und sicher Ihren eigenen Businessplan zu erstellen.Jeder Beginn ist schwierig: Das spÃ¼ren wir auch daran, dass wir von Ihnen immer mehr Anfragen zur Gestaltung von GeschÃ¤ftsidee, Planungsprozessen etc. haben. Daher werden in den folgenden Artikeln die Bereiche Idee, wesentliche Fragestellungen vor Beginn der SelbstÃ¤ndigkeit, Business Plan und Finanzierungen behandelt. Wir beginnen mit dem Brainstorming - wir hoffen, im Verlauf der Serie einige Antworten geben zu kÃ¶nnen.Wenn man sich entscheidet, sich selbstÃ¤ndig zu machen, gibt es oft schon AnsÃ¤tze oder eine Anregung. Vom Auto zum Beton zu gelangen, bedeutet, sich Zeit fÃ¼r aktives "Drehen" zu lassen und Ã¼ber die eigene Lage und die denkbaren Chancen nachzudenken. Nachfolgend einige einfache Kreativtechniken, die oft zu Ã¼berraschenden Ergebnissen fÃ¼hren: Klassisches Ideenfindung wird empfohlen, bei der Sie verschiedene Leute bitten, zusammenzukommen und alle Vorstellungen zu einem bestimmten Themenbereich auszusprechen.Das Sammeln dieser Vorstellungen kann dann gegliedert werden. An dieser Stelle werden die genannten und viele andere kreative Techniken vorgestellt, die alle dazu beitragen, aus den Ã¼blichen Denkpfaden herauszukommen und neue Impulse zu geben. Tip: Schauen Sie nicht zu eng nach einer Idee, sondern geben Sie Ihren Ãberlegungen freien Lauf und Sie erhalten trotzdem die besten Resultate.Viele Gedanken kommen zum Beispiel in der Duschkabine, in der Toilettenkabine oder vor dem Schlafengehen auf. Jede Ideenfindung stÃ¶Ãt an ihre Grenze, wenn wesentliche Erkenntnisse nicht vorliegen, z.B. wenn Fragen zur Machbarkeit, Marktlage etc. nicht bekannt sind. Wenn die allgemeine Ausrichtung eindeutig ist, ist es sinnvoll, sich an den derzeitigen Absatzmarkt zu wenden und alle verfÃ¼gbaren Daten zu sammeln.Es gibt unterschiedliche MÃ¶glichkeiten, einen Ãberblick Ã¼ber den gewÃ¼nschten Absatzmarkt zu gewinnen: Ein Einstieg kann ein persÃ¶nliches GesprÃ¤chsthema mit Kolleginnen und Kollegen sein. Denn hier ist es leicht, in alle Himmelsrichtungen zu befragen und Tendenzen und Probleme aufzuspÃ¼ren. Doch: Bei letzterer ist nie mit Gewissheit davon auszugehen, dass alles Wesentliche aufgezeichnet wurde, daher sollte das Netz nur einen Teil der Orientierungsgrundlage darstellen.Wer einen groben Eindruck hat, sollte sich die Wettbewerbssituation auf dem Arbeitsmarkt nÃ¤her ansehen: Idealerweise wird der Gedanke mit jedem weiteren Betrachtungsschritt weiterentwickelt. Dies ist im Grunde genommen erfreulich, da immer wieder neue EinfÃ¤lle auftauchen. Schon bald sollte man nicht nur neue Impulse geben, sondern sie auch zu Papier bringen und sorgfÃ¤ltig abwÃ¤gen.Ich schlage vor, dass Sie die folgenden Anfragen in schriftlicher Form beantworten: Was gibt es fÃ¼r Marktinformationen? Gerade diese Fragestellungen bilden die Basis eines jeden Businessplanes. Hinweis: Diese Frage ist nicht nur fÃ¼r Sie von Bedeutung, sondern kann auch genutzt werden, um Ihre Idee zukÃ¼nftigen Partnern oder Sponsoren zu prÃ¤sentieren.In der folgenden Eingabe gehen wir dann auf die Einzelkomponenten des GeschÃ¤ftsplans nÃ¤her ein. Erstellung eines Business Plans Schritt 2: WofÃ¼r ist er da? Und wer wird mir helfen? Bevor grÃ¶Ãere Ãnderungen im Betrieb und im Absatzmarkt, sei es die Basis, sei es eine neue ProdukteinfÃ¼hrung oder eine Erweiterung, sollten Sie einen GeschÃ¤ftsplan erstellen.Wer jedoch Ã¼ber den eigenen Bedarf nachdenkt und nichts anderes fÃ¼r den GeschÃ¤ftsplan benÃ¶tigt, kann oft noch nicht berÃ¼cksichtigte Aspekte aufdecken. Warum ein GeschÃ¤ftsplan? Der GeschÃ¤ftsplan verhilft nach einer erfolgreichen GeschÃ¤ftsidee bei Detailfragen zu den Themen MÃ¤rkten, Wettbewerb, Vermarktung und Kostenrechnung zu einem vertieften VerstÃ¤ndnis der eigenen GeschÃ¤ftssituation und des Marktes, gibt damit Entscheidungssicherheit und gibt Auftrieb.Damit ist der Business Plan zunÃ¤chst eine Roadmap durch eine eigene Anfangs- und Entwicklungsphase. Hinweis: Der GeschÃ¤ftsplan wÃ¤chst ebenso schnell wie das Unter-nehmen. Der GeschÃ¤ftsplan fungiert auf lange Sicht als Orientierung fÃ¼r ExistenzgrÃ¼nder und Arbeitnehmer, da die Unternehmensausrichtung, die Unternehmensziele und -strategie festgelegt und ein FÃ¼hrungssystem fÃ¼r die Unternehmenssteuerung geschaffen wird.Mit einer guten Wartung kann der GeschÃ¤ftsplan nicht nur eine ungefÃ¤hre Orientierungshilfe sein, sondern auch dazu beitragen, Soll-Ist-Vergleiche vorzunehmen, FlaschenhÃ¤lse zu identifizieren und eigene Vorstellungen zu befragen. Korrekt erstellt und graphisch ansprechend, kann der Business Plan auch als FirmenprÃ¤sentation fÃ¼r den Kundenkontakt genutzt werden. Jeder, der einen GeschÃ¤ftsplan entwickelt, kennt auch den Absatzmarkt, das eigene Unternehmen, die eigenen Zielsetzungen, die eigenen Strategie und die Kostenplanung und muss nicht vor Diskussionen zurÃ¼ckschrecken, sondern kann im Gegenteil Wissen Ã¼bertrumpfen.FÃ¼r einen GeschÃ¤ftsplan mÃ¼ssen erst nach der Entwicklung der Idee Fragestellungen zur angestrebten Gesellschaftsform beantwortet werden. Eine erste Ãbersicht fÃ¼r kleine Start-ups finden Sie im Beitrag zur SelbstÃ¤ndigkeit neben Studien und Beruf. Derartige GrÃ¼ndungsinitiativen sind in der Regel kostenfrei und fÃ¼hren Sie von der Konzeption Ã¼ber den Business Plan bis hin zu den ersten Unternehmensschritten.Nun zum Wesentliche, dem GeschÃ¤ftsplan selbst und seiner Erstellung. Wir haben bereits an anderer Stelle darauf hingewiesen, dass die Erstellung von BusinessplÃ¤nen sehr aufwÃ¤ndig und zeitintensiv ist. Zahlreiche wesentliche Teile des GeschÃ¤ftsplans wirken folgerichtig und werden rasch aufbereitet. Tip: Sie wollen den GeschÃ¤ftsplan nicht an einem einzigen Tag erstellen. Schon allein der Rahmen eines Business Plans macht es notwendig, etwas mehr Zeit zu planen: Er kann zwischen 10 und 30 Blatt umfassen, je nachdem, wie kompliziert das Stiftungsprojekt und der jeweilige Zielmarkt sind und welche Voraussetzungen (z.B. ÃberprÃ¼fung durch Finanzierer oder Banken) der Business Plan erfÃ¼llen soll.Tip: SchlÃ¼ssige Formulierung, aber haarfeine Einzelheiten kÃ¶nnen weggelassen werden. Einen Businessplan zu erstellen ist eine herausfordernde Aufgabe: Er sollte so anschaulich sein, dass der Nutzer sich etwas unter den einzelnen Punkten vorstellt, es aber auch technisch richtig und ausfÃ¼hrlich ausdrÃ¼cken kann. Man kann sich beim Verfassen von Texten gut vor Augen fÃ¼hren, dass jemand aus einem ganz anderen Gebiet den Plan gelesen hat und ihn trotzdem versteht - der Lesende sollte immer an die Wand gegriffen werden.Falls Sie sich nicht ganz sicher sind, ob Ihr GeschÃ¤ftsplan dies zulÃ¤sst, lassen Sie es sich von ein Paar Freunden durchlesen und bewerten, wie spannend und leicht es ist. Der GeschÃ¤ftsplan sollte fÃ¼r einen raschen und Ã¼bersichtlichen Aufbau sorgen, denn nicht jeder kennt die gesamte BroschÃ¼re. Inhaltsverzeichnisse am Anfang sowie gleichmÃ¤Ãige Rubriken und Gliederungen in Themenparagraphen sollten fÃ¼r einen GeschÃ¤ftsplan selbstverstÃ¤ndlichkeit sein.FÃ¼r einen GrobÃ¼berblick verwenden die meisten Interessierten zunÃ¤chst die Businessplan-Zusammenfassung, die den Plan einfÃ¼hrt. Die Kurzfassung legt fest, ob der restliche Businessplan Ã¼berhaupt noch zu lesen ist. Tip: Schreibe die Kurzfassung zuletzt, denn dann sind die wichtigsten Aspekte in den Detailkapiteln bereits ausgearbeitet und man muss nur noch zusammentragen.Der GeschÃ¤ftsplan verfolgt nach dieser Ãbersicht eine ungefÃ¤hre Struktur, die in der Regel dieser entspricht: Hier werden die folgenden Aspekte im Detail ausgearbeitet:

ÀÑCopyright (C) övàc@l_ËsYÆU»àc@All Rights Reserved.Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) are powered by hydrogen. They are more efficient than conventional internal combustion engine vehicles and produce no tailpipe emissions—they only emit water vapor and warm air. FCEVs and the hydrogen infrastructure to fuel them are still in an early stage of deployment. The U.S. Department of Energy is leading government and industry efforts to make hydrogen-powered vehicles an affordable, environmentally friendly, and safe transportation option. Hydrogen is considered an alternative fuel under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and qualifies for alternative fuel vehicle tax credits.FCEVs use a propulsion system similar to that of electric vehicles, where energy stored as hydrogen is converted to electricity by the fuel cell. Unlike conventional internal combustion engine vehicles, they produce no harmful tailpipe emissions. Other benefits include increasing U.S. energy security and strengthening the economy.FCEVs are fueled with pure hydrogen gas stored in a tank on the vehicle. Similar to conventional internal combustion engine vehicles, they can fuel in less than 5 minutes and have a driving range over 300 miles. FCEVs are equipped with other advanced technologies to increase efficiency, such as regenerative braking systems, which capture the energy lost during braking and store it in a battery. Major automobile manufacturers are offering a limited number of production FCEVs to the public in certain markets, in sync with what the developing infrastructure can support.The most common type of fuel cell for vehicle applications is the polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell. In a PEM fuel cell, an electrolyte membrane is sandwiched between a positive electrode (cathode) and a negative electrode (anode). Hydrogen is introduced to the anode and oxygen (from air) to the cathode. The hydrogen molecules break apart into protons and electrons because of an electrochemical reaction in the fuel cell catalyst. Protons travel through the membrane to the cathode.The electrons are forced to travel through an external circuit to perform work (providing power to the electric car) then recombine with the protons on the cathode side, where the protons, electrons, and oxygen molecules combine to form water. See the fuel cell animation or the Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) infographic to learn more about the process.More Hydrogen Data | All Maps & DataMore Hydrogen Case Studies | All Case StudiesMore Hydrogen Publications | All PublicationsAll ToolsYour zip code ${/spectrumbusinessprofile/zipcode}Your current location is ${/spectrumbusinessprofile/zipcode}.

Develop a sound business planSuccessful entrepreneurs do a lot of background research before they sell their products and services. A business plan pulls it all together. Your plan should include:Try our interactiveÂ Scotia Plan WriterÂ for businessÂ®2. Invest in your own education
Self-education could be as specific as learning how the latest piece of software can help your business. Or it could be mastering the different skills youâll need to run your business, such as marketing, finance, and customer service. The more you can learn about the overall operations of your business, the better your decisions will be - particularly if you run a smaller company that requires you to take more than one role.3. Get your finances in order
Save as much money as you canÂ beforeÂ you start your business; you may need to draw on your savings in the early stages. You should also establish and maintain a good credit history, which will help you when you need to borrow money for your business.4. Keep your overhead low
There are many stories of entrepreneurs starting out in their garages until they have built up their business. Starting small and keeping your costs low lets you make mistakes on a much smaller scale and gives you the time to learn from them. Email and the Internet make it easy to start your business from your home.5. Learn from the experts
Take advantage of the expertise of an accountant and business banker. An accountant can help you with the books, find ways to keep your costs low, and do your tax return. Your business banker will be able to guide you on cash flow, the use of credit, investments, and borrowing, among other things. He or she can also share best business practices.Astute observation and sound judgement are a great start to understanding your customers and market. Here are a few easy ways for you to get toÂ know your customers and your market.

Dezember 28, 2018 Extracting Clinical Research Data From the EHR Using SMART on FHIRLearn more about Business Review WebinarsIf you have previously registered for this event, please login below:All fields below are required.Clinical research is probably the last industry on the planet where data can only be moved from one computer system to another by typing it in again. Why canât the requisite data be extracted automatically from the patientâs Electronic Health Record? For years, this has been deemed impossible for a variety of technical, regulatory and patient privacy reasons. 


However, with the advent of a new architecture called SMART and a new communications protocol called FHIR, the automatic extraction of data from the EHR is now eminently feasible. 


Join us for a webinar to understand this ground-breaking new technology and what it means for the future of Clinical Data Management.  Kim Rejndrup, senior vice president â Product Development, is helping drive OmniCommâs products to new levels of innovation. Mr. Rejndrup spent nearly 20 years at Oracle Corporation, where he was a vice president of Development for many clinical research applications, including systems for electronic data capture (EDC), clinical trials management, data management, medical coding and data warehousing.
Mr. Howells has served as the Companyâs chief technology officer since June 2017. He served as Senior Vice President of Development from April 2012 until June 2017. He joined OmniComm in January 2011, with responsibility for the development and forward direction of the companyâs products. 


Mr. Howells has more than 20 years of experience in building and implementing clinical research applications, including five years as head of development for Oracle's pharmaceutical application suite and five years as head of development for Medidata Solutions. This encompasses applications for clinical data management, EDC, medical dictionary coding, safety, trial planning and trial budgeting. Mr. Howells has a degree in physics from Oxford University, England.You can find Business Review Webinars on Social Media platforms.

Federal Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna tactfully welcomed Saskatchewan’s climate change plan, “Prairie Resilience: A Made-in-Saskatchewan Climate Change Strategy”, released December 4, 2017. Saskatchewan’s plan doesn’t set greenhouse gas reduction targets or propose a price on carbon. Instead, it promises a range of regulatory measures, the use of offsets, and various measures to adapt to a changing climate.McKenna believes Saskatchewan, the lone provincial holdout on carbon pricing, is taking a step in that direction with this plan. The plan calls for the development of “sector-specific output-based performance standards on facilities emitting more than 25,000 tonnes of CO2e per year.” Facilities that fail to meet these standards will have several compliance options, which include purchasing credits from better performers or paying into a technology fund.There are exemptions, explains Brendan Frank, analyst with Canada’s Ecofiscal Commission. Coverage will be minimal, but compliance with the standards could take the form of carbon pricing.“It’s probably not enough to satisfy the requirements of the Pan-Canadian Framework [on Clean Growth and Climate Change] and therefore likely not enough for Saskatchewan to avoid the federal backstop,” Frank tells EcoLog News.The plan isn’t a complete bust, says Frank. It acknowledges the importance of adaptation, for instance, with proposals around community preparedness, transportation and infrastructure. It addresses emissions from agriculture, an important source of emissions, particularly in Saskatchewan, and one that is largely insulated from the impacts of carbon pricing. The province will develop and implement an offset system that will create more incentives in the agricultural and forestry sectors for carbon sequestration and reduced emissions.Saskatchewan’s plan is also the first one in Canada to acknowledge “internationally transferred mitigation outcomes” (ITMOs — the term coined in the Paris Agreement for internationally traded offsets and allowances) as a compliance mechanism for large emitters, says Frank.But the absence of a broad-based carbon price, as called for in the Pan-Canadian Framework, may prove to be its fatal flaw. McKenna suggests as much in her statement:“Based on what’s in today’s plan, Saskatchewan’s price likely wouldn’t hit our standard, because it applies only to heavy industry instead of being economy-wide,” she said. “Of course, we hope that will change as Saskatchewan’s government turns its plan into action.”Frank labels it a missed opportunity. Regulatory measures are likely to come at a higher cost to the economy than a carbon price. And the revenue from a carbon price can readily be recycled into the Saskatchewan economy to achieve any number of worthwhile goals.With a carbon tax at $20 per tonne, Frank says Saskatchewan could probably raise $800 million. That would be enough to eliminate the corporate income tax, he says, or pay a quarterly dividend of $175 to every Saskatchewan resident.“A carbon tax doesn’t necessarily mean paying more tax,” he says. “It just means changing the way taxes are paid.”Back to Headlines | Top of Page¹æÅº¼Ò³â´Ü ºôº¸µå Å°¿öµå°¡ °¡¿ä°è¸¦ °­Å¸ÇÏ¸é¼­ ±× ¹è°æ¿¡ °ü½ÉÀÌ ¶ß°Ì´Ù.21ÀÏ ±¹³» À¯¸í ¿Â¶óÀÎ Ä¿¹Â´ÏÆ¼ °Ô½ÃÆÇ¿¡´Â ‘¹æÅº¼Ò³â´Ü ºôº¸µå, ´ëÁßµµ ¸ô¶ú´ø ±×µéÀÇ ½ÅÈ­’¶ó¸ç ±×µéÀÇ ¾÷Àû¿¡ ´ëÇÑ ±ÛµéÀÌ ¼Ó¼Ó ¿Ã¶ó¿À¸é¼­ ¶ß°Å¿î ÀÌ½´°¡ ¶Ç ´Ù¸¥ ÀÌ½´¸¦ ³º°í ÀÖ´Ù.¹æÅº¼Ò³â´Ü ºôº¸µå°¡ ÀÌÃ³·³ À½¿ø ½ÃÀåÀÇ ºòÀÌ½´·Î ÀÚ¸®ÀâÀº ÀÌÀ¯´Â »ç½Ç»ó ¶Ç ´Ù¸¥ Àü¼³·Î ÀÚ¸®¸Å±èÇÏ°í ÀÖ´Â ÀÎ±â±×·ì ¹æÅº¼Ò³â´ÜÀÌ Ú¸ 'ºôº¸µå ¹ÂÁ÷ ¾î¿öÁî'¿¡¼­ ´ëÇÑ¹Î±¹ ¹ÂÁö¼Ç ÃÖÃÊ·Î 2³â ¿¬¼Ó ¼ö»óÇÏ´Â ±â¿°À» ÅäÇß±â ¶§¹®.‘¹æÅº¼Ò³â´Ü ºôº¸µå’°¡ ÀÌ·± Ãß¼¼¶ó¸é 3³â ¿¬¼Ó ¼ö»óµµ °¡´ÉÇÑ °Í ¾Æ´Ï³Ä´Â °üÃøÀÌ ³ª¿À´Â °Ç ÀÌ ¶§¹®ÀÌ´Ù.¹æÅº¼Ò³â´Ü ºôº¸µå »Ó ¾Æ´Ï¶ó ±×µéÀÌ ÇöÀç °¡¿ä½ÃÀå¿¡¼­ ¼­¼úÇÏ°í ÀÖ´Â Àü¼³Àû Çàº¸´Â ´Ü¼øÇÑ Áßµ¶¼ºÀ¸·Î º¸±â¿£, ±× À½¾ÇÀû Æ÷ÀÎÆ®°¡ ´Ù¸¥ °¡¼öµéµÂ 180µµ ´Ù¸£´Ù´Â Æò°¡´Ù.°ü·Ã ´º½º¸¦ Á¢ÇÑ ÆÒµé°ú ´©¸®²ÛµéÀº “¿òÁ÷ÀÌ¸é ¿ÃÅ³” “¼½½Ã Æ÷ÅÙ ÅÍÁ³´Ù” “·Î¸ÇÆ½ º¸ÀÌ½º, Áö±ÝºÎÅÍ Âß °¡ÀÚ” µîÀÇ ¹ÝÀÀÀ» º¸ÀÌ°í ÀÖ´Ù.ÀÌ¹ÌÁö = ¼Ò¼Ó»ç Á¦°øÀÌÄÚ³ë¹ÌÅå´º½º, ECONOMYTALKÁÖ´Ù¿µ ÀÌÄÚ³ë¹ÌÅå´º½º ±âÀÚ  pr@economytalk.kr<ÀúÀÛ±ÇÀÚ © ÀÌÄÚ³ë¹ÌÅå´º½º, ¹«´Ü ÀüÀç ¹× Àç¹èÆ÷ ±ÝÁö>

There are various reasons why you may feel nervous:There are many more reasons beyond this why you get nervous. You could be nervous just because it's an interview and people are supposed to be nervous! This article will teach you how to calm yourself before an interview, how to handle the jitters during an interview, as well as some of my own experiences.There are steps you need to take prior to going into the interview and prior to the interview itself. These steps will allow you to calm yourself before an interview. I have used these techniques myself, and they work.Essentially, you want to prepare yourself for every contingency ahead of time. If you forget something, end up running late, or something else happens prior to the interview, it will just add to your nervousness. If you don't have your act together, the interviewer may see that as well.Once you are sitting in the waiting room, you can find your nervousness grow. Use these tips to calm yourself before the interview:These are general tips you can use when having an interview of any kind, whether it be on the phone, one-on-one, or a panel.One-on-one interviews are more intimate in a way that the interviewer will have all eyes on you, and your eyes will always be on them. This can be a good or bad thing, depending how you handle yourself. Here are some tips on how to handle your nervousness during a one-on-one interview.Panel interviews can be much harder to contend with. Not only do you have to endure an interview, you have to do it in front of multiple people. That could just compound your nervousness, making it harder for you to sell yourself. Use these tips on how to alleviate that nervousness during a panel interview.I have a few experiences I can share when it comes to being nervous during a job interview, which can provide some insight on how being nervous can affect your chances of getting a job.Â© 2013 David Livermoreby Cynthia Hoover3by chirls9by David Livermore6by Sally Hayes5by Pamela Oglesby29by Igor Hulz0by Lisa4by Annette Thomas12Sign in or sign up and post using a HubPages Network account.No HTML is allowed in comments, but URLs will be hyperlinked.

I tend to be more nervous with panel interviews though, so prefer one-to-one.hyp 5 years ago Thank you for sharing your experience. I'm always feel nervous during interview. I'll remember your tips.Jim Niemela 5 years ago from UtahGreat post!  Thanks for the tips.Elizabeth Parker 5 years ago from Las Vegas, NVGreat tips.  I worked in staffing for a while and even though I know the tactics to use and many tips, I still found myself nervous when I had to go on interviews. I think it's important to remember that you are interviewing the company just as much as they are interviewing you.  Sure, you want to get the job, but you also want it to be a good fit for you.  If only we can remember that when we go on an interview!  Thanks for the great info!LizDavid Livermore 5 years ago from Bakersfield, California, United StatesThat is a good response.  I'll have to remember that at my next interview!  Thanks!Jennifer Vasquez 5 years ago from Long Beach, CAHelpful tips, and some I hadn't thought of.  I have also heard that another way to respond to a question you don't know how to answer is to respond with,"That's a good question," as a way to gain yourself a few more seconds to think of something.  These tips will come in handy for me in the near future!David Livermore 5 years ago from Bakersfield, California, United StatesI agree with most of these.  However the interviews I went on didn't ask about the organization at all.  Mostly my skills, how I would handle scenarios, etc.  Problem with interviews is that you never know what they will ask!havingmysay 5 years ago from USAWhat I have discovered in my interviews is that the potential employer will ask questions related to a "weakness" you may have or a conflict you have had on a job.  The best way to respond is to answer the question by giving an example of an instance that has occurred and then state how you rectified the problem/conflict or how you have made efforts to turn you "weakness" into a strength.In addition, it is always helpful to research the company you are interviewing with.  Employers always ask a question or two that will let them know just how much energy you have placed into finding out about their organization.  Research the company you are interviewing with is also a great way to come back with a substantially intelligent question when they ask, "Do you have any questions for me?"Milan Padariya 5 years ago from AhmedabadVery nice and Informative...Thanks to share with us..Really good....Copyright © 2019 HubPages Inc. and respective owners.

They went above and beyond our expectations.A properly working heating system is crucial to the efficiency and comfort of your home. At Halco our experts know exactly how important it is to have a heating system that won’t cost more money than necessary and will keep your home comfortable. If you have an older heating system that may not be running properly the short-term issue is that your home is not as comfortable as it could be. The long-term issue is that you are losing money. If you are struggling with a boiler or furnace that is old or not working properly, updating it will save you money on your energy bill.Halco does not only do heating system installation, we are also industry leaders when it comes to heating system repairs. Our team of professionals understands exactly what it takes to keep your heating system running smoothly and your family warm. We have the expert crews and technicians to make long-lasting heating system repairs, including boilers and furnaces. Always remember to contact a professional if you notice any problem with your heating system. Postponing maintenance can make things worse and cause further issues down the road and create more heating system repairs.Many homeowners are under the impression that their home is properly insulated. However, when we take a look we find that the majority of homes do not have the proper amount of insulation. We find the wrong types of insulation used, insulation in the wrong locations, gaps in the insulation and in some cases no insulation at all. What does that all mean? It means you are spending far more money than necessary to keep your home comfortable. Stop wasting money, contact the professions at Halco today!The idea of home insulation has been around for centuries. Cavemen lived in caves because of the natural protection it afforded them. Modern dwellings do not naturally keep the inhabitants warm and comfortable, insulation must be added to get the job done. Pink fiberglass insulation was used for decades but now Polyurethane spray foam is the best product available. By adding additional attic insulation, you will make your home more comfortable and save money on your energy bills. We all know that heat rises and as a result attic insulation can have a major impact on the efficiency of your home. When you are heating your home in the colder months that heat will rise and escape through your attic. Depending on the size of your home the amount of heat that will escape could be equivalent to keeping a window open. In a national study, the average R-value found in an average attic is R-19 while the U.S. Department of Energy recommends an R-value between R-49 and R-60. Halco has the trained professionals who will be able to give you certainty about the attic insulation in your home and its overall efficiency. Call or click today to Save up to 20% or more in heating and cooling costs with a properly insulated attic!Halco is a full-service plumbing company that can handle any of your plumbing repair and installation needs.

All Rights ReservedSite by Rareview Lets start with Coal. In the coming Paper, the current coal-euphoria has been scrutinised and a couple of issues are worth a mention. Primo: it was found necessary to emphasize the difference between coking coal (metallurgical) and thermal coal both in terms of values and of markets. This is crucial in various ways because, although not always explicitly referred to, what the mining companies (hereinafter designated by extractors) are primarily looking for in the Tete Basin is Coking Coal and not really the Thermal one. Hence, in order to reach a plausible 2020-forecast for the Tete coal basin, and its induced significance on the Indian Oceans seaborne trade, a critical review has been made on the marketing potential offered by the quality of these two types of Tetes coal and, in particular, on their linkage with the Coke Connection and the mineral trinity (iron ore, coking coal and nickel) that drive their well established dominance of the global maritime trade in a world characterized by the trilogy population-urbanization-motorization. One of the products of this research is a matrix of coal flows in 2020. This matrix, although quite conservative if compared to the wide range of publicly announced disparate figures, suggests at least a duplication of the number of large dry-bulk carriers navigating the Channel of Mozambique as a result of the exponential growth of coal exports  63 MTPA, excluding new transits from RSA, Botswana and Zimbabwe. This coal-matrix also evidences the rather geo-dispersed nature of eventual maritime flows from the coast of Mozambique and the managerial potency required by their underpinning continental corridors. Implicitly, the matrix anticipates an eventual degree of technical sophistication that unequivocally points to the urgency of investing smartly on maritime promptness from now on  particularly in Mozambique that, nowadays, handles less than 14 MTPA of dry-bulks and 1,227 recorded vessel annual calls.Energy and Mining Corridors 2020Good Morning...

It's not about the home business, nor about what you are doing as much as who you are being.  Be true to the real you, the brilliant, spectacular, talented and remarkable you, and guess what?Your business will skyrocket.Posted September 19th, 2006 by WendyCategories: Success Thinking,  Productivity,  Overcoming ObstaclesThe first post in this series:
The Business Boxing Match :: Success vs. FailureThe second post in this series: Fight the Inner Battle :: Sneaky Tools to WinThe third post in this series:Go to the Mattresses :: Overcoming Obstacles vs. Untapped PotentialThe fourth post in this series:Claim the Victory :: Embrace your Success This upcoming weekend I am gearing up to be a trainer at the sales seminar that saved my life. Iâm super-duper excited. In honor of this, and the critical material we cover in the live event, Iâm going to do a series of posts this week on Values Conflicts.Huh? Values conflicts? Yes - they are the single biggest destroyer of small business. Values conflicts are responsible for creating the obstacles we must overcome to succeed. Allow me to explain:We all have good values we hold in high esteem. For most of my readers, I can guess at several of them: Family time. Success. Love. Growth. Connection. Comfort. Freedom. Achievement.
We also have values that we would do just about anything to avoid. Rejection. Fear. Anger. Frustration. Humiliation. Self Doubt. Unworthiness. Lack of Control. Guilt. Iâll call these avoidance values.Values conflicts arise when we percieive a risk of feeling one of our avoidance values in order to move towards one of our good values. Hereâs the important part - we may not even be conscious of the perceived risk. Allow me to give you an example:I had a friend that was preparing herself to be a Small Business Coach. She found an opportunity to be mentored by someone with extensive credentials, and who also offered to help her build her coaching business. She is the kind of person that would be an extraordinary coach - focused, experienced, well-read, and very influential and admired in her local community.But she hated to sell.In fact, it wasnât just a hatred - it was a downright replusion of the whole idea. Mention sales to her, and she could only think of a used car salesperson with a hard-close rehearsed and at the ready.
Not surprisingly, her coaching practice wasnât doing very well. As a business owner, whenever she had an opportunity to âpitchâ her business, she said the right things, but her voice was timid. And her body language was completely incongruent with the words coming out of her mouth. She would state that she is a great coach that got results. But she sounded like she was a timid mouse, and she would even physically recoil as she spoke.My friend had values of success, contribution, and hard work. She was enthusiastic and likable.  She also had a ton of guts, determination, and a willingness to go the distance to make her business a success. Not to mention talent - loads of talent.But she had one teensy weensy avoidance value - rejection.There is one rule that I want you to remember when it comes to values. So important Iâm going to shout it out in all caps and bold letters:WE WILL ALWAYS DO MORE TO AVOID PAIN
THAN WE WILL TO ATTAIN PLEASURE.My friend had all of the right ingredients for success - she already posessed everything she needed to make it BIG as a coach. But because she had to risk rejection in order to grow her business, she consistently acted in ways that did NOT support her business, sabotaging her own success. Every week she took one step forward and two steps back. And she was suffering emotionally, financially and even physically because of it.~This is just one example of how an avoidance value can destroy a business. If you can see even a little bit of yourself in this picture, if you hear a little whisper of recognition, then return all week for some daily insights and even some action items into managing values conflicts :: for your self and for your business.As momtrepreneurs, solopreneurs, and even dadtrepreneurs, working at home usually means that we donât have someone else to hold us accountable for our decisions and actions. Because of this, we donât have someone who can objectively review our business actions and call us on our own bull$#it when we choose to act on an avoidance value instead of a good one.Think itâs easy to spot in your business? Probably not. But hereâs a start:Action item for today :: List out your top 6 good values (the things you love to feel) and your top 6 avoidance values (the things you hate to feel).The next post in this series is Fight the Inner Battle :: Sneaky Tools to WinTags: Values, Conflicts, Values Conflicts, Professional Development, Personal Development, Self Help, Business Failure, Self Sabotage, Success, Success Thinking, Overcoming Obstacles, Work at Home, Self Employment, Productivity, Focus, Home Business, Home Based Business, What do you think?

  audit;  Province's clean-energy bill would 

  raise hydro rates, promote alternative power and create 50,000 jobsThe Toronto Star: Rob Ferguson - 

  February 24, 2009 Ontario residents won't be able to 

  sell their houses or condos without first getting a home energy audit - which 

  now costs about $300 - under the proposed new Green Energy Act.That's one of several measures in 

  the legislation unveiled by Energy Minister George Smitherman to boost incentives 

  for electricity conservation and encourage renewable sources of energy.The legislation was applauded by 

  environmentalists as ambitious, although the David Suzuki Foundation says its 

  green intent is undermined by government plans to build a new nuclear power 

  plant at Darlington.But critics fear the energy audits 

  and Smitherman's estimated 1 per cent rise in household electricity bills as 

  a result of the law will pinch pocketbooks as the recession deepens."It'll be used to beat down 

  the seller of a home," Progressive Conservative MPP and energy critic John 

  Yakabuski warned of the audit, which would put detailed information on a home's 

  energy efficiency into the hands of buyers.Toronto homeowners are already concerned 

  about the impact the city's new land transfer tax - in addition to the provincial 

  one - is having on sales and prices. Both taxes add up to thousands of dollars 

  even on cheaper houses.As for higher electricity prices, 

  Smitherman promised measures to help low- income families but said anyone thinking 

  prices will fall is mistaken as governments around the world try to curb greenhouse 

  gases that cause global warming."Most people expect that electricity 

  prices will be going up," he told a news conference, adding that there 

  are incentives and government aid under the act to help homeowners improve their 

  energy conservation efforts.While homeowners will have to get 

  a private contractor to do an energy audit before selling, there will be no 

  requirement to take any action - the measure is simply intended to inform potential 

  buyers what state of energy efficiency a property is in so they can take action 

  if desired.But New Democrat MPP and energy critic 

  Peter Tabuns (Toronto-Danforth) said the act - which will also update the provincial 

  building code to require new buildings to be more efficient and require higher 

  efficiency standards for appliances - just doesn't go far enough."What we've seen today is still 

  too timid compared to what we need in Ontario," Tabuns said, citing as 

  an example that Portugal now requires solar systems in new houses.The higher cost on electricity bills 

  - and many of the 50,000 jobs that the government claims the act will create 

  over three years - will stem initially from a $5 billion investment to improve 

  the electricity transmission and distribution grid.Smitherman's plan is to modernize 

  it so homeowners, for example, can put solar panels on their rooftops and sell 

  any excess power they don't need back into the system at a price yet to be determined, 

  making the grid a "two-way street."Utilities such as Toronto Hydro will 

  undertake that work under ministerial directives to be issued soon, Smitherman 

  said.Government programs, still in the 

  developmental stages, would provide low- interest or no-interest loans to help 

  homeowners pay for the solar, thermal, ground source heat pumps and micro-wind 

  energy systems that will be promoted under the act, which still requires a vote 

  of the Legislature this spring."There will be strong incentive 

  for people to be small-scale energy producers," Smitherman said. "The 

  vision here is thousands and thousands and thousands of Ontarians into the game."The question is will Ontarians be 

  able to afford it, said Yakabuski, who noted there won't be any details for 

  months on how much financial aid citizens can expect or how much they'll be 

  paid for any electricity they provide the grid."They've got to put a lot of 

  meat on these bones," said Rick Smith of Environmental Defence, who nevertheless 

  hailed the Green Energy Act as a way to slow the pace of global warming and 

  help attract "billions of dollars in (green) investment ..."Smitherman's prediction of 50,000 

  jobs is also fuelled by provisions in the act to require Ontario-made content 

  in green energy projects, such as steel in wind turbines that could come from 

  mills in Hamilton or Sault Ste. Marie.No content level has yet been set 

  but it will be over 25 per cent, government officials suggested."It's going to be able to put 

  people back to work," said Ken Neumann, director of the United Steelworkers 

  union in Canada.Smitherman said the home energy audits 

  will help create "green" jobs for auditors, with plans to phase the 

  requirement in over a longer period because there are not enough contractors 

  in the auditing business to meet demand.As for wind turbine projects, like 

  the controversial proposal for one in Lake Ontario off the Scarborough Bluffs, 

  standards for setbacks from property will be set in the coming months by the 

  environment ministry.Smitherman said the distance currently 

  envisioned is 500 metres - further than some existing wind turbine projects 

  are from homes - but that the legislation would not be retroactive, so no turbines 

  now in place would have to be moved.

        Tribal Government
Window Rock, Arizona is the Navajo Nation capital. Since
        1989, the Navajo Nation has governed itself using a three-branch system
        of government: 

 The Executive Branch is headed by the President and Vice President.
Elected
officials
serve a four-year term by the popular vote of the Navajo people. 

 The Judicial Branch is headed by the Chief Justice of the Navajo Nation,
is appointed
by the President, and is confirmed by the Navajo Nation Council. 

 The Legislative Branch is comprised of 88 members called council delegates
or
the Navajo Nation Council. Legislators serve a four-year term and are elected
by the registered voters of all 110 chapters, the smallest administrative units
of the Navajo Nation. 

      Navajo Nation Flag

On
        May 21, 1968, the Navajo Nation Council adopted this flag, designed by
        Jay R. Degroat, a Navajo from Mariano Lake, New Mexico and selected from
      140 entries.(more)
        Navajo Tribal Seal
On
        January 18, 1852, the Navajo Nation council adopted the great seal, designed
        by John Claw, Jr. of Many Farms, Arizona. The 50 arrowheads outlining
        the seal symbolize the tribe's protection within the 50 states. The opening
        at the top of the three concentric lines is the east; the lines represent
        a rainbow and the sovereignty of the Navajo Nation.(more)

        Local Governance
        Local governance occurs through entities called “Chapters,” which
        are geographically subdivided populations of tribal members. Each of
        the Navajo Nation’s 110 chapters is centered near a population
        center. 

        The Local Governance Act enables tribal members to vote on local economic
        development issues, such as the granting of home and business site leases
        within the community. Though chapters have significant power in the community
        with planning and development, the ultimate authority legally remains
        in the hands of the Navajo Nation Council.

During 2011, 7,450 million cubic metres of gas were distributed, a decrease of 503 million cubic metres, or 6.3%, compared to 2010, mainly due to the milder temperatures recorded during the year.At 31 December 2011, Snam had concessions for gas distribution services in 1,449 municipalities (1,448 at 31 December 2010), of which 1,330 were in operation and 119 had to complete and/or create the networks. It had 5.897 million active meters at gas redelivery points to end users (households, businesses, etc.), compared with 5.848 million at 31 December 2010.As at 31 December 2011, the gas distribution network covered 50,301 kilometres (50,307 kilometres at 31 December 2010). The slight reduction of six kilometres is due to the balance between the increases and decreases in the network. The increases are primarily due to:Compare the key figuresof the past years.

Haberer Insurance recommends that all businesses have general liability coverage in place.Errors & Omissions (E&O) covers professionals for negligence and errors or omissions that injure their clients or cause damage to a third partyâs data. This type of insurance is particularly important to licensed professionals such as accountants, attorneys, insurance agents, architects, engineers and technology companies. Haberer Insurance recommends that all professional and technology companies have E&O coverage.Employment Practices Liability Insurance for employers covers employment-related liabilities other than on-the-job injuries. This can include legal fees and damages for suits such as wrongful termination, discrimination, sexual harassment, and other alleged violations of employeesâ legal rights. If you have employees, Haberer Insurance recommends considering this type of coverage.D&O insurance covers directors and officers of a company for negligent acts or omissions and for misleading statements that result in lawsuits against the company. There is a variety of Directors and Officers coverage available such as corporate reimbursement coverage, personal liability, and entity coverage. D&O policies may be broadened to include coverage for employment practices liability as well.To find out more about these, as well as other business insurance products and services, call us and weâll help make sure youâre properly covered.Spring Cleaning Tips – Spring is a time for new beginnings, and cleaning and organization around the house are very popular this...   more »Home  |  About  |  Contact  |  Service  |  Mortgages  |  Privacy  |  Disclaimer  |  Search © 2019 Haberer Insurance Agency 5041 Hickory BlvdHickory, NC 28601

Les tribunaux de commerce sont soumis aux dispositions communes Ã  toutes les juridictions. Ils relÃ¨vent des mÃªmes valeurs dÃ©ontologiques que celles applicables aux magistrats et rendent leurs dÃ©cisions au nom du peuple franÃ§ais.
Mais la justice commerciale comporte des spÃ©cificitÃ©s tenant Ã  la nature du mandat de ses juges : ils sont Ã©lus, bÃ©nÃ©voles et peuvent exercer concomitamment une activitÃ© commerciale ou industrielle. Nous venons tous de l'entreprise. Nous la connaissons, c'est notre force, nous en sommes proches, c'est notre risque. Paradoxalement, en valorisant notre expÃ©rience professionnelle et notre connaissance des milieux Ã©conomiques, nous nous exposons Ã  des contraintes dÃ©ontologiques plus fortes que d'autres.
Il est pour cela devenu plus indispensable que jamais de prÃ©venir toute situation potentiellement constitutive de conflits d'intÃ©rÃªts au sein de nos tribunaux. Cette exigence d'impartialitÃ© fait l'objet de dispositions lÃ©gales particuliÃ¨res dans le domaine des entreprises en difficultÃ©. Dans tous les autres cas, elle se manifeste dÃ¨s l'audience : les juges du commerce doivent s'interdire de traiter l'affaire d'une personne ou d'une sociÃ©tÃ© avec lesquelles ils sont en relation directement ou indirectement ou avec laquelle ils sont en concurrence. A aucun moment ne peut Ã©merger une opinion favorable ou non Ã  l'une des parties Ã  l'affaire, pas mÃªme lors de la rÃ©daction des jugements.
Mais cette rigueur doit s'imposer au-delÃ . Les comportements ou les propos des juges en dehors de leurs tribunaux doivent Ãªtre exemplaires afin de ne pas obÃ©rer l'image d'impartialitÃ© qui est attendue de leur fonction. Aucune interfÃ©rence ne doit Ãªtre tolÃ©rÃ©e avec des engagements pris Ã  titre privÃ©, associatifs, philosophiques, qui seraient de nature Ã  influencer l'activitÃ© juridictionnelle.
L'exigence d'impartialitÃ© est donc trÃ¨s large et, en pratique, le juge doit s'abstenir de participer Ã  toute formation de jugement pour prÃ©venir toute situation constitutive de conflit d'intÃ©rÃªts. Il doit, selon la terminologie juridique, se Â« dÃ©porter Â». C'est le cas lorsqu'existent des relations rÃ©guliÃ¨res avec une des parties ou un lien Ã©conomique isolÃ© mais significatif et rÃ©cent. La dÃ©tention directe ou indirecte d'une partie au capital de l'entreprise en difficultÃ©, fÃ»t-elle marginale, constitue aussi une cause d'abstention. Tout comme d'Ã©ventuelles nÃ©gociations engagÃ©es au prÃ©alable qui, relevant d'une relation personnalisÃ©e avec le dÃ©biteur, doit conduire le juge Ã  s'abstenir.
Nous disposons, depuis longtemps, d'un code de dÃ©ontologie et d'une commission des sanctions qui condamne le manquement Ã  ces obligations. Nous attendons aussi avec impatience la publication par la chancellerie du Recueil des obligations dÃ©ontologiques sur lequel nous avons longuement travaillÃ© ces derniÃ¨res annÃ©es. L'objectif recherchÃ© dans le projet de rÃ©forme sur la justice du XXIe siÃ¨cle prÃ©sentÃ© par la garde des Sceaux consiste Ã  inscrire dans le Code de commerce, Ã  l'instar des magistrats professionnels, les obligations dÃ©ontologiques du juge du tribunal de commerce. Pour la ConfÃ©rence gÃ©nÃ©rale des juges consulaires de France (CGJCF), qui fait de cette question l'une de ses prioritÃ©s, il est important de s'inscrire dans une dÃ©marche plus large de diffusion de la culture dÃ©ontologique. Celle-ci doit s'appuyer sur la mise en place au sein de chaque tribunal d'une veille dÃ©ontologique avec un juge rÃ©fÃ©rent qui, avec le prÃ©sident, constitue un vecteur important pour irriguer cette culture. Cette dÃ©marche volontariste, qui est celle de la CGJCF avec l'appui souhaitÃ© des services compÃ©tents de la chancellerie, est - nul ne peut en douter - partagÃ©e par les 3.200 juges consulaires de notre pays.

150 mÃ¨tres carrÃ©s ultra-sÃ©curisÃ©s Ã  Elancourt, dans les Yvelines. Les portables restent Ã  l'entrÃ©e ; seules les personnes habilitÃ©es par le ministÃ¨re de la DÃ©fense peuvent travailler dans la salle de contrÃ´le d'Airbus Cybersecurity. Une vingtaine de professionnels surveillent, jour et nuit, les rÃ©seaux des entreprises qui ont confiÃ© leur sÃ©curitÃ© informatique Ã  cette filiale du groupe Airbus. PrÃ©cieux, Ã  l'heure oÃ¹ un piratage colossal de donnÃ©es confidentielles - 57 millions de comptes hackÃ©s - vient d'Ã©clabousser Uber, aprÃ¨s Yahoo (3 milliards de donnÃ©es piratÃ©es), la chaÃ®ne de supermarchÃ©s Target (100 millions de donnÃ©es clients), l'organisme de crÃ©dit Equifax (145 millions) et bien d'autres vicimes de cyberattaques de moindre ampleur mais tout aussi prÃ©judiciables.Â Â 
A l'aide de sondes placÃ©es aux endroits stratÃ©giques des rÃ©seaux informatiques des entreprises, le SOC -Â  le nom du centre opÃ©rationnel d'Airbus Cybersecurity - dÃ©tecte la moindre anomalie.Â  Ransomware, dÃ©ni de service, sabotage , etc., Â toutes les infractions sont traquÃ©es Ã  distance. Les sondes font remonter en temps rÃ©el l'Ã©tat du trafic jusqu'Ã  Elancourt. Les informations, anonymisÃ©es lors de la visite des Â« Echos Executives Â», sont modÃ©lisÃ©es sur les Ã©crans de la salle de contrÃ´le.Â Â«Â Lorsqu'une intrusion est dÃ©tectÃ©e, nous informons tout de suite le client. Â», explique FrÃ©dÃ©ric Julhes, directeur gÃ©nÃ©ral d'Airbus Cybersecurity.Â Â« L'action suivante consiste Ã  tracer l'attaque, puis Ã  la sÃ©curiser Â». La fine connaissance des attaquants est un enjeu majeur dans la lutte contre la cybersÃ©curitÃ©. Chez Airbus, 135 groupes de pirates informatiques sont dans le viseur. Leur typologie est large.Â Â«Â Cela va du groupe terroriste au mercenaire qui dÃ©robe des donnÃ©es pour les revendre Ã  des entreprises industrielles, en passant par le groupe d'activistes de type Anonymous Â», prÃ©cise le dirigeant.Â Â«Â  L'enjeu est de circonscrire l'attaque sans l'arrÃªter, afin de comprendre d'oÃ¹ elle vient, d'amÃ©liorer notre connaissance des pirates et d'anticiper les prochaines attaques.Â Â»
CrÃ©Ã© en 2012, le SOC surveille actuellement les rÃ©seaux de trente clients, parmi lesquelsÂ  des opÃ©rateurs d'importance vitale, les fameux OIV . Le prix de cette prestation comprend, d'une part, la mise en place des sondes et leur paramÃ©trage qui demandent trois Ã  six mois dans le cadre d'une grande entreprise et, d'autre part, des prestations de surveillance. Soit environ un million d'euros pour la premiÃ¨re partie, plus un service contractualisÃ© de surveillance, sur trois Ã  cinq ans, d'environ 200.000Â euros par an.
L'annÃ©e 2017 a Ã©tÃ© dominÃ©e par des attaquesÂ  de type ransomware, Â logiciel malveillant qui prend en otage les donnÃ©es personnelles. L'annÃ©e 2018 s'annonce sous les mÃªmes auspices. A ceci prÃ¨s, que le dÃ©veloppement des objets connectÃ©s (IoT) dans l'industrie vient fragiliser la forteresse informatique. Selon le directeur d'Airbus Cybersecurity, l'intelligence artificielle sera un outil prÃ©cieux pour analyser le flux de donnÃ©es qui Ã©manent des entreprises.Tous droits réservés - Les Echos 2019

عالمنا
فقدت الليرة التركية نحو 40% من قيمتها أمام الدولار منذ بداية العام وحتى الآن. هذا الانهيار الشديد دفع عددًا من وكالات الائتمان الدولية والخبراء الاقتصاديين إلى التحذير من أزمة اقتصادية كاملة في تركيا. هذا الانهيار الشديد يؤثر في الاقتصاد التركي الذي يشهد منذ 2016 أزمة اقتصادية حادة، تسببت في ارتفاع معدلات التضخم إلى 15% على أساس سنوي، وهو المعدل الأعلى منذ الأزمة الاقتصادية الأخيرة التي عاشتها تركيا في بداية الألفية الثالثة. تعيش الليرة حالة من الانهيار أمام الدولار بداية من 2012، حين سجل الدولار متوسط 1.7 ليرة. أما الآن، فالدولار يقارب 6.5 ليرة، ما يعني أن الدولار تضاعف نحو أربع مرات أمام الليرة في آخر ست سنوات فقط.يعكس هذا الانخفاض المستمر أزمة عميقة في الاقتصاد التركي نفسه، ويطرح للدول النامية مثالًا جيدًا حول مدى فعالية واستدامة هذا النموذج الاقتصادي والتنموي، والذي يعتمد بالأساس على الاقتراض لتمويل النمو. أيضًا يطرح هذا الموضوع سؤالًا آخر حول تصاعد السلطوية في النظام التركي، ومدى تأثير ذلك في الاقتصاد. تبدو أزمة الاقتصاد التركي الحالية شبيهة، إلى حد بعيد، بأزمة النمور الآسيوية أواخر القرن العشرين، والتي اندفعت أيضًا بتأثير عجز الميزان التجاري، ما أنتج أزمة كبيرة في سوق العملة، وانخفضت قيمة عملات هذه البلدان أمام الدولار بشدة.كمعظم الاقتصادات الناشئة، يعاني الاقتصاد التركي من غياب اليقين حول مستقبله وارتباطه بآفاق المستقبل العالمي.تركيا التي شهدت خلال العشرين عامًا الأخيرة قفزة اقتصادية مدفوعة بالاقتراض شديد الكثافة، والذي موَّل النمو الاقتصادي، ورفع معدلات التشغيل، وبخاصة في قطاعات البنية التحتية التي غيَّرت من الوجه العمراني لتركيا خلال تلك الفترة. لم تكن تلك معجزة اقتصادية كبيرة على عكس ما يروج بعضهم،

 فدائمًا تمتلك الاقتصادات الناشئة، مثل الاقتصاد التركي، إمكانيات كبيرة لتحقيق معدل نمو مرتفع، خصوصًا إذا كانت الدولة تمتلك سوقًا محلية كبيرة جدًّا بحجم تركيا التى يقارب سكانها الثمانين مليونًا. فمن المتوقَّع أن يزيد الناتج المحلي بنسب كبيرة، مدفوعًا بشدة بزيادة الطلب الاستهلاكي المحلي الذي يعمل بدوره على تشغيل الدورة الاقتصادية بشكل أكثر كفاءة. هذا ما كان كينز سوف يقوله الآن إذا كان بيننا.خلال تلك الحقبة، روَّج الاقتصاد التركي نفسه باعتباره اقتصادًا ناشئًا ذا إمكانات كبيرة، وبخاصة في قطاع الصناعات التحويلية (الملابس بالأساس)، وساعد على نمو هذا القطاع أن العمالة التركية أرخص مقارنة بجيرانها الأوروبيين، ومهارتها مقبولة جدًّا مقارنة بأجورها. لذلك يمكن أن يرتفع الطلب العالمي عليها، ما دفع المستثمرين المحليين والأجانب إلى ضخ كثير من الأموال في سوق الصناعات التحويلية التركية. أيضًا في القطاع العقاري، والذي يبدو أقل من حيث القيمة المضافة، وأقل تأثيرًا في الميزان التجاري للدولة التركية، ضخت أنقرة كثيرًا من الاستثمارات، لكن جاءت تلك الاستثمارات المباشرة مع قرينتها غير المباشرة، وأيضًا الاقتراض المفرط للشركات التركية الكبرى، وبخاصة من البنوك الأوروبية. كمعظم الاقتصادات الناشئة، يعاني الاقتصاد التركي من غياب اليقين حول مستقبله وارتباطه بآفاق المستقبل العالمي. مثلًا تؤثر أسعار النفط بشدة في معدل التضخم في تركيا لأنها دولة مستوردة للطاقة. وحتى لو كانت حالة انعدام اليقين تلك مدفوعة بالتغيرات السياسية الداخلية، كما حدث في محاولة انقلاب 2016، فإنها تؤثر وبشدة في عقلية المستثمرين في السوق التركية. كذلك أثرت الحرب التجارية مع الولايات المتحدة بشدة في الوضع الاقتصادي التركي، وبدأت الحرب التجارية للرئيس ترامب بفرضه رسومًا جمركية على بضائع صينية، تصل قيمتها إلى 34 مليار دولار، لاحقًا أعلن ترامب الحرب على جميع الأطراف: أوروبا وكندا، وحتى تركيا. شكَّل وصول ترامب إلى السلطة في 2017 صدمة كبيرة للعالم الذي وجد نفسة أمام شخص من خارج أجندة السياسية التقليدية، يدفع بخطاب معادٍ للعولمة، على عكس المتوقَّع، ويركز على الداخل الأمريكي. من الممكن القول إن الثمار الحقيقية للعولمة جنتها الدول النامية والاقتصادات الناشئة. ورغم اختلال التجارب التنموية في تلك الدول على مستوى توزيع أرباح النشاط الاقتصادي، وحتى انخفاض القيمة المضافة في الاقتصادات ككل، لاعتماد هذه الدول على الصناعات التحويلية بشكل رئيسي (المنسوجات في حالة تركيا مثلًا، والإلكترونيات في حالة النمور الآسيوية)، ومن ثَم اعتمادها على استيراد مدخلات الإنتاج من الخارج. تركيا أيضًا تعتمد في اقتصادها الإنتاجي على هذا القطاع بشكل كبير، وحتى في صادراتها. لذلك، حينما يعمد الأمريكيون الخروج من هذا الإجماع الاقتصادي حول العولمة،

 ويعهدون إلى فرض تعريفات جمركية على بضائع تلك الدول الناشئة، فمن المؤكد أن تلك الدول ستتأثر، وبشدة.ما أجج الأزمة العميقة التي يعيشها الاقتصاد التركي منذ 2012، الخصومة السياسية مع الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية بعد احتجاز تركيا الجبري للقس الأمريكي «أندرو برونسون». ورغم أن الاقتصاد التركي سجل معدلات نمو جيدة، تخطت 7% في السنتين الأخيرتين، فإنها لم تكن كافية لمنع الأزمة الحالية.لم يكن ترامب يريد سببًا ليخوض حرب «الجميع ضد الجميع» التي يشنها من أجل أن يجعل أمريكا «عظيمة» مرة أخرى. لكن جاء القس الأمريكي منحة من السماء ليستمر في حربه ضد تركيا. «أندرو برونسون»، وهو قس أمريكي يدير كنيسة صغيرة في تركيا، اعتقلته السلطات التركية، ووجهت إليه اتهامات بالتعاون مع حركة الخدمة، وزعيمها فتح الله كولن، الذي تتهمه الحكومة التركية بالتخطيط لانقلاب 2016. من تداعيات هذا الموقع، جمدت الحكومة الأمريكية أصولًا تعود إلى وزيري العدل والداخلية في حكومة أردوغان، قبل أن تعود بعدها بأيام قليلة، ويصرح «ويبلر روس»، وزير التجارة الأمريكية، بأن الولايات المتحدة ستضاعف من التعاريف الجمركية على البضائع التركية التي تستوردها. لاحقًا دعا أردوغان مواطنيه إلى مقاطعة البضائع الأمريكية ردًّا على العقوبات الأمريكية على بلاده. أيضًا نشرت الجريدة الرسمية التركية قرارًا بفرض رسوم جمركية، تصل إلى 140% على البضائع الأمريكية، منها السيارات والكحول والتبغ. يميل التبادل التجاري بين البلدين لصالح الولايات المتحدة التي تصدر لتركيا أكثر مما تستورد، ومن ثَم، سيتأثر الاقتصاد التركي. هنا ليس الحديث فقط عن الأثر الاقتصادي المباشر، لكن عن الأثر الأكثر خطرًا، وهو ثقة المستثمرين في بلد لا يتمتع اقتصاده بقوة كافية ليشكل اقتصادًا مستقرًّا على المدى الطويل. لذلك سيحجب هذا جزءًا من الاستثمارات الأجنبية المباشرة.على المستوى الداخلي تُضخم الحكومة التركية كثيرًا من هذه الحرب التجارية. فمنذ الانقلاب العسكري في 2016، يحاول أردوغان إقناع شعبه بألا يشتري الدولار أو اليورو، وأن يحتفظ بالليرة التي تقل قيمتها يومًا بعد الآخر،

 وأن الأتراك لن ينجوا من أزمة العملة إلا بتضامنهم.وفي السياق نفسه، أعلنت قطر عن نيتها القيام باستثمار مباشر في تركيا بقيمة 15 مليار دولار، فيما يبدو كمساندة لتركيا في أزمتها، ومحاولة لوقف الهبوط السريع للاقتصاد التركي.لكن في العموم، تبدو الخطابات التركية الشعبوية مفرطة في الثقة، ولا تدرك أن الأزمة بالفعل أكبر من مجرد من حرب الولايات المتحدة التجارية على العالم، وأن الأمر يتخطى هذا إلى النموذج الذي تبناه أردوغان نفسه في النمو الاقتصادي، والذي يعتمد في الجزء الأكبر من تمويله على اقتراض الحكومة والقطاع الخاص لتوفير فرص العمل والحفاظ على معدلات البطالة في أقل مستوياتها من أجل الانتخابات.مع عدم استقرار البنية الاقتصادية بشكل كامل، وعدم وجود سياسات تراقب السوق بشكل فعال، تكون الدولة في مهب الرياح.تعاني تركيا من عجز في ميزان تجارتها الخارجية. فوارداتها أكثر من صادراتها، والعجز يجب أن يُموَّل، إما من استثمارات أجنبية، وإما بالاستدانة. ولا يعد هذا بحد ذاته غريبًا أو خطيرًا، لكن العجز لدى تركيا أصبح كبيرًا جدًّا ليبلغ 5.5% من إجمالي الناتج المحلي 2017. هذا العجز لا يعكس فقط أن حجم صادرات الاقتصاد التركي من السلع والخدمات أقل من حجم وارداته، لكنه كذلك (بالتدقيق في هيكل العجز) يعكس مدى التشوه الذي أصاب الاقتصاد التركي،

 التشوه المتمثل في الاستثمارات الأجنبية غير المباشرة في الأوراق المالية، وبخاصة أدوات الدين قصير الأجل في تركيا. الدولة النامية أو الاقتصاد الناشئ، في العالم الذي يبحث فيه كبار المستثمرين عن الربح لا غيره، لن يمكنهما أن يجلبا فقط الاستثمار الأجنبي المباشر، أي في القطاعات الإنتاجية في الاقتصاد، والتي تسهم في توظيف مزيد من العمالة وتقليل معدلات البطالة ورفع المستويات المعيشية لغالبية السكان، وهو ما حدث في التجربة التركية جزئيًّا. لكن بجانب هذا، يأتي الأثر الجانبي. فالدولة الناشئة تقترض كثيرًا من السوق العالمية، لدرجة أن تصل ديونك الخارجية إلى 453 مليار دولار، أي ما يقارب نصف الناتج المحلي الإجمالي. حينها لا بد من أن تقع هذه الدولة في فخ الأموال الساخنة، وهي الاستثمارات غير المباشرة، بالذات في أدوات الدين قصيرة الأجل والأسهم، والتي سرعان ما تتبخر وتحلق نحو دولة أخرى في ظل أي تهديد أو عدم استقرار. ومع عدم استقرار البنية الاقتصادية بشكل كامل، وعدم وجود سياسات أو تشريعات تراقب هذه السوق بشكل فعال، فالدولة إذًا في مهب الرياح. في 1998، كتب خبراء صندوق النقد تعليقًا على أزمة النمور الأسيوية، إذ استنتجوا أن المشكلة كانت في عدة محاور، أهمها غياب الرقابة على سوق أدوات الدَّين في إطار سعي تلك الدول للحصول على معدلات نمو مرتفعة وقدرة تشغيلية كبيرة للاقتصاد. يرى خبراء الصندوق الذين روجوا في تسعينيات القرن العشرين لنموذج واحد من العولمة الليبرالية متمثلًا في سياسات تحرير سعر الصرف، وفتح الأسواق أمام حركة رؤوس الأموال، أن كثيرًا من الاستدانة يسهم في عدم استقرار هياكل الاقتصاد الداخلية في الدولة، ولذلك يطرح إمكانية حدوث أزمة كبيرة. أيضًا يرى هؤلاء أن دول جنوب شرق آسيا كانت بحاجة لمزيد من التشريعات الاقتصادية التي تضع في الاعتبار جذب الاستثمار الأجنبي، لكن بضوابط معينة، منها الحفاظ على استقرار أسعار الفائدة. في أزمة دول جنوب شرق آسيا، أسهمت أسعار الفائدة المنخفضة في هروب كثير من المستثمرين الأجانب نحو بلدان أخرى، مثل الولايات المتحدة واليابان، والذين بدورهم رفعوا أسعار الفائدة أكثر. هنا يتحدد، في نموذج النمو بالاستدانة، مدى قدرة الدولة النامية على تحمل التنافسية في أسعار الفائدة مع الدول الكبرى التي تبدو ذات هياكل اقتصادية أكثر ثباتًا وقادرة على تأمين احتياجاتها التمويلية بشكل أكثر استدامة. هذا بالضبط ما حدث مع تركيا. الفيل في الغرفة كما يقال، وهذا الفيل كان الدَّين، وحين أحس مستثمرو الأموال الساخنة بأن هيكل الاقتصاد التركي هش،

 رغم معدلات النمو المرتفعة، وبدأوا سحب أموالهم الساخنة نحو مناطق أخرى في العالم تتمتع بأسعار فائدة أعلى، انخفضت الليرة مقابل الدولار. يصر أردوغان على التدخل في سياسات البنك المركزي التركي، فالرجل لديه رؤية اقتصادية تبدو صحيحة نظريًّا، وهي أن الإبقاء على معدلات فائدة منخفضة سيشجع الاستثمار المحلي، بما يمكن أن يسهم، على المدى الطويل، في تعديل هيكل الاقتصاد نفسه، بالاعتماد على الاستثمار المحلي. حالة نجحت الصين في تحقيقها خلال عقدي ثمانينيات القرن العشرين وتسعينياته، وهو المحافظة على معدل ادخار عالٍ، واستثمار محلي مرتفع في قطاعات إنتاجية تساعد على التشغيل والتصدير. لكن تلك الاستشرافية طويلة الأمد لا تصلح في الوقت الحالي، ما دفع البنك المركزي التركي أخيرًا إلى رفع أسعار الفائدة بنسبة 3%، على أمل أن يبطئ من هروب الأموال الساخنة، فيتوقف نزيف الليرة أمام الدولار.أردوغان يرى أن أسعار الفائدة، وبحسب تصريح سابق له، هي «أم الشرور». يمكنني في سياق آخر أن أتفق معه، لكن في الوقت الحالي، والذي يعتمد فيه النموذج التركي بشكل كبير على الاقتراض من أجل النمو، لا يصلح هذا. ففي النهاية يقع الاقتصاد التركي بأكمله تحت سكين الاستثمار الأجنبي.يمكننا تلخيص الأزمة التركية الحالية بأنها الإفراط في العولمة النيوليبرالية، وليست فقط الإفراط في الاقتراض.الإفراط في الاقتراض يمكنه تقريبًا تفسير الأزمة التركية الحالية، وبخاصة أنها ليست فقط أزمة الدين الحكومي الخارجي، لكنها كذلك أزمة الشركات والبنوك التركية التي ترتبط بشكل كبير بمنظومة الاستدانة تلك. فهي تمتلك ما يقرب من نصف الديون الخارجية، ولذلك في تلك المرحلة يقع الاقتصاد كله في فخ الدَّين، وأي تخلف عن السداد من الممكن أن يزيد من قلق المستثمرين والبنوك الأجنبية التي يمكن أن تتخلف، في أي لحظة، عن إقراضك مزيدًا من الأموال. يرى كثير من المحللين أن الأزمة الحالية لليرة التركية بسبب الاقتراض الزائد عن الحد. لكن «مايكل روبرتس»، الاقتصادي الإنجليزي، يرى أن الأمر لا يبدو فقط أزمة سياسات مالية أو نقدية خاطئة للحكومة التركية، إذ يتخطى ذلك إلى وضع أكثر صعوبة، فرفع الولايات المتحدة أسعار الفائدة قد يضر كثيرًا بالاقتصادات الناشئة في العالم.تكمن مشكلة النموذج الاقتصادي التركي في أنه دائمًا على حافة الانهيار، بسبب اعتماده على الاستدانة الخارجية لتمويل النمو.

 لكنها ليست مشكلة الأتراك وحدهم، فالعالم المعولَم بالكامل، والذي يضمن تدفقًا سهلًا وحركة أكبر لرؤوس الأموال، أخذ ينهار في ظل تراجع الولايات المتحدة، المروِّج الأول للعولمة، عن تلك السياسة، وعلى الجميع الآن أن يدفع هذا الثمن. بعد مرور ما يقرب من ثلاثة عقود من العولمة النيوليبرالية، وعقد واحد من أزمة اقتصادية كبيرة عاشها العالم في 2008، ما زالت جميع الحكومات تدفع الثمن الباهظ لغياب الرقابة على الأسواق، على المستوى القومي، وغياب الرقابة على حركة رؤوس الأموال، على المستوى العالمي. يمكننا إذًا أن نلخص أزمة تركيا الحالية بأنها الإفراط في العولمة النيوليبرالية، وليست فقط الإفراط في الاقتراض. الشعبوية قد تجعلك تكسب الانتخابات، لكنها من الممكن أن تخيف المستثمرين أيضًا.تدخَّل أردوغان كثيرًا فى أعمال البنك المركزي التركي، الذي يبدو مستقلًّا فقط على الورق، لكن من الإجحاف أن نقول إن هذا هو السبب المباشر للأزمة، فالأمر له علاقة أكثر بهيكل الاقتصاد. أيضًا كان مبرر الولايات المتحدة في حربها التجارية ضد تركيا سببًا سياسيًّا عندما احتجزت تركيا القس الأمريكي، لكن هذا أيضًا في نظري ليس سببًا مباشرًا للأزمة، وإن أسهم في ظهورها وتضخيمها إعلاميًّا في الفترة الأخيرة.إذًا، ما السياسة التي أتحدث عنها؟ تعاني النظم التي ما زالت لم تنجز مرحلة التحول الديمقراطي بشكل كامل، وما زالت العلاقات المدنية العسكرية فيها ضبابية بشكل كبير، من تشوه في الهيكل الاقتصادي

 أولًا على مستوى القاعدة الاقتصادية التي تعاني من معدلات فساد ومحسوبية بسبب غياب الشفافية بشكل كبير. أيضًا خضع الاقتصاد التركي والسياسات الاقتصادية لأجندات العدالة والتنمية الانتخابية التي تسعى إلى إرضاء الناخب التركي الذي أصبح لا يقبل بمستوى معيشي أقل مما وصل إليه في العقدين الأخيرين. بينما يواجه حزب «العدالة والتنمية» انخفاضًا في شعبيته بسبب تراجع المكاسب الاقتصادية للمواطنين الأتراك، وخصوصًا في الحواضر الريفية التي تمثل القاعدة الانتخابية الأكبر للحزب الذي يسعى، عبر تبني خطابات شعبوية، إلى الحفاظ على ما تبقى له.الشعبوية قد تجعلك تكسب الانتخابات، لكنها من الممكن أن تخيف المستثمرين أيضًا. في الفترة الأخيرة، وبعد الانقلاب تحديدًا، تبنَّى العدالة والتنمية خطابًا عدائيًّا ضد جميع الأطراف، وبخاصة الأوربيين والأمريكيين الذين وجد فيهم أردوغان شمَّاعة جاهزة ليعلق عليها كل هذا الفشل الاقتصادي في الأونة الأخيرة. أيضًا، وعلى مستوى السياسة الخارجية، يقلل أردوغان من فرص الدعم الإقليمي له، سواء من ممالك الخليج (عدا قطر)، والتي كان يمكن أن تقرضه كثيرًا من الأموال، ليحل أزمة العملة الحالية التي يعاني منها. هذا مثلًا حدث مع باكستان سابقًا حين لجأت إلى السعودية في أزمة مماثلة.يمكننا القول إن السياسات الاقتصادية التركية أسهمت في التشوه الذي يعاني من عواقبه الاقتصاد التركي الآن، السياسات المتركزة بشكل أساسي حول الاقتراض من أجل تمويل النمو، ويبدو أن هذا سيستمر على المدى القريب، لكن بطريقة أكثر رشدًا، بعد أن تلجأ الحكومة التركية إلى المؤسسات الدولية من أجل خطة إنقاذ، إذا استمرت الأزمة الحالية في التفاقم.نشر في 2018/08/15

Heating and domestic hot water needs will be satisfied by an innovative energy solution: Hythane(1), a new gas composed of hydrogen and natural gas. The aim of the project is to demonstrate the technical, economic, environmental and social advantages of this new energy solution for sustainable cities and green mobility in real operating situations.The project was launched in 2014. The first two years were devoted to a phase of technical and sociological studies, followed by a five-year demonstration phase of two uses of hydrogen injection: transport and housing.The French government is supporting the GRHYD hydrogen energy storage demonstrator project now being conducted by ENGIE and a consortium of industrial partners(2). France has set the target of meeting 23% of its gross end-user energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020. This ambitious project aims to convert surplus energy generated from renewable sources into hydrogen, which will then be blended with natural gas for a broad range of applications, including space heating, water heating and fuel. As a result, generators of energy from intermittent renewable sources, such as wind and solar power, will have a new solution for marketing the electricity they generate, at the same time as reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Development of hydrogen in this way delivers a direct response to a series of energy and environmental challengesâ¦ Power to gas : The GRHYD demonstrator makes it possible to valorize the ENR (green electricity not finding an outlet on the electricity network) in the form of hydrogen gas distributed in the natural gas network, by implementing the Power-to-Gas concept. To evaluate the technical, economic and environmental relevance of Power-to-Gas, two demonstrators for this new energy solution are now up-and-running as part of a project involving local authorities and local residents in the Dunkerque Urban Community: The results of a simulation of the gas and hydrogen needs of the first 100 homes made it possible to determine what hydrogen installations would be required for electrolysis, storage and injection, and which models.The proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer can produce up to 10 normal cubic meters of hydrogen per hour. The storage module has a capacity of 5 kg. The hydrogen is stored thanks to a technological innovation, in the form of metal hydrides.The electrolyzer and storage technology have been tested in real operating situations to meet the energy demands of neighborhood residents.Hydrogen converted back into gaseous form can be injected into the natural gas network to constitute a new fuel. The demonstration starts with the injection of the first molecules of hydrogen into the distribution network to supply homes in the new neighborhood.The quantity of hydrogen mixed with the natural gas will vary depending on the availability of green electricity while remaining below 20% in volume in order to respect safety regulations.Partners in the GRHYD project inaugurate Franceâs first Power-to-Gas demonstrator (1) Fuel composed of hydrogen and natural gas.(2) Twelve industrial partners are taking part in the GRHYD demonstration project alongside ENGIE. Companies include GrDF, GNVERT, AREVA Hydrogen and Energy Storage, CEA, McPhy Energy, INERIS, CETIAT and CETH2."Power to gas" : an innovative solutionJavaScript seem to be disabled in your browser.You must have JavaScript enabled in your browser to utilize the functionality of this website.USER PORTALThe review system is a way for customers of this business to easily share their opinion.

company ID number 556302-9726, hereby submit the annual accounts

and consolidated financial statements for the 2011/2012 financial

year.The year's good development of both sales and earnings is a

combination of sound organic growth and implemented acquisitions,

which developed well in the Group.On the whole, demand was good for our operations during the

first half of the year. Organic growth was also healthy during the

second half, despite several customers being more cautious in their

order forecasts. Demand in our product and market areas continued

to develop positively.The market is more fragmented than in the past and we are seeing

substantial variations between different geographic markets,

customer segments and product niches. Demand from Nordic healthcare

was stable at a high level throughout the financial year. In the

market for production components for Nordic manufacturing

companies, a certain degree of restraint towards the end of the

year mostly affected the Group's operations in Sweden and Denmark.

The Group's companies in Norway, Finland and markets outside the

Nordics continued to perform well.The business has developed extensively in recent years, partly

thanks to the increase in contacts and cooperation between the

Group's subsidiaries. In parallel, a large number of newly acquired

companies have been added, which also contributed to the need for

change in our operations and offering. As a result of these

developments we implemented a small-scale reorganisation in the

Group, effective as of 1 April 2012. The reorganisation comprised

moving a number of companies between our four business areas and

creating two new business units. The reorganisation did not affect

the Life Science business area. See also Note 5 Segment reporting.

As of the first quarter of the 2012/2013 financial year, reporting

for the Group will be according to this new structure.To sum up, the 2011/2012 financial year was a positive year for

growth in both sales and earnings. The year was characterised by

good organic growth and several successful acquisitions that have

developed well in the Group. All business areas strengthened their

positions in various markets and reported a positive earnings

trend, but the market is more fragmented than in the past.Financially speaking, the Group's position was robust during the

year, maintaining a high equity ratio and a low net debt/equity

ratio. We have surpassed, and have also increased, our

profitability goal for P/WC. As a result, the Group generated

strong cash flow from operations during the year, which has been

used for investments in existing operations and acquisitions of new

companies. The Group is thereby very well-equipped for further

expansion of its business. The focus in several areas during the year was to implement

acquisitions and invest in existing operations to enhance the

Group's market position in selected segments and niches. The Group

is very well-equipped for further expansion of its business.phone +46-8-4704900ï»¿

Disputes - International: stretching over 250,000 km, the world's 325 international land boundaries separate 195 independent states and 71 dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, and other miscellaneous entities; ethnicity, culture, race, religion, and language have divided states into separate political entities as much as history, physical terrain, political fiat, or conquest, resulting in sometimes arbitrary and imposed boundaries; most maritime states have claimed limits that include territorial seas and exclusive economic zones; overlapping limits due to adjacent or opposite coasts create the potential for 430 bilateral maritime boundaries of which 209 have agreements that include contiguous and non-contiguous segments; boundary, borderland/resource, and territorial disputes vary in intensity from managed or dormant to violent or militarized; undemarcated, indefinite, porous, and unmanaged boundaries tend to encourage illegal cross-border activities, uncontrolled migration, and confrontation; territorial disputes may evolve from historical and/or cultural claims, or they may be brought on by resource competition; ethnic and cultural clashes continue to be responsible for much of the territorial fragmentation and internal displacement of the estimated 20.8 million people and cross-border displacements of approximately 12.1 million refugees and asylum seekers around the world as of mid-2013; over half a million refugees were repatriated during 2012; other sources of contention include access to water and mineral (especially hydrocarbon) resources, fisheries, and arable land; armed conflict prevails not so much between the uniformed armed forces of independent states as between stateless armed entities that detract from the sustenance and welfare of local populations, leaving the community of nations to cope with resultant refugees, hunger, disease, impoverishment, and environmental degradationRefugees And Internally Displaced Persons: the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated that as of the end of 2012 there were 45.2 million people forcibly displaced worldwide; this includes 15.4 million refugees, 937,000 asylum seekers, and 28.8 million conflict IDPs (another 32.4 million IDPs were displaced by natural disasters); the UNHCR estimates there are currently 10-12 million stateless persons (2012)Trafficking In Persons: current situation: approximately 800,000 people, mostly women and children, are trafficked annually across national borders, not including the millions who are trafficked within their own countries; at least 80% of the victims are female and up to 50% are minors; 75% of all victims are trafficked into commercial sexual exploitation; almost two-thirds of the global victims are trafficked intra-regionally within East Asia and the Pacific (260,000 to 280,000 people) and Europe and Eurasia (170,000 to 210,000 people) (2012) ; Tier 2 Watch List: (44 countries) Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Bahrain, Belarus, Belize, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Myanmar, Burundi, Cambodia, China, Comoros, Cyprus, Djibouti, Guinea, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Kenya, Laos, Lebanon, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mali, Marshall Islands, Morocco, Namibia, Pakistan, Panama, Qatar, Rwanda, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Solomon Islands, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, Tanzania, Timor-Leste, Tunisia, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uruguay ; Tier 3: (23 countries) Algeria, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Cuba, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Iran, North Korea, Kuwait, Libya, Malaysia, Mauritania, Papua New Guinea, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Thailand, Uzbekistan, Yemen, Venezuela, Zimbabwe (2014)Illicit Drugs: cocaine: worldwide coca leaf cultivation in 2007 amounted to 232,500 hectares; Colombia produced slightly more than two-thirds of the worldwide crop, followed by Peru and Bolivia; potential pure cocaine production decreased 7% to 865 metric tons in 2007; Colombia conducts an aggressive coca eradication campaign, but both Peruvian and Bolivian Governments are hesitant to eradicate coca in key growing areas; 551 metric tons of export-quality cocaine (85% pure) is documented to have been seized or destroyed in 2005; US consumption of export quality cocaine is estimated to have been in excess of 380 metric tons ; opiates: worldwide illicit opium poppy cultivation continued to increase in 2007, with a potential opium production of 8,400 metric tons, reaching the highest levels recorded since estimates began in mid-1980s; Afghanistan is world's primary opium producer, accounting for 95% of the global supply; Southeast Asia - responsible for 9% of global opium - saw marginal increases in production; Latin America produced 1% of global opium, but most was refined into heroin destined for the US market; if all potential opium was processed into pure heroin, the potential global production would be 1,000 metric tons of heroin in 2007Copyright Â© Economywatch.com. All Rights ReservedSite by RareviewOne of the most common types of business insurance is commercial property insurance, which provides a wide range of coverage for buildings, inventory, equipment, tools and more. Losses from fire, break-in, vandalism, wind and other natural or manmade disasters are examples of what is typically covered.A basic commercial property insurance policy may be all you need, although the types of coverage can vary between different insurance companies. As an independent insurance agent, Family Trust can help you determine the type of insurance policy and range of coverage that is best for your business.For a full list of coverage available, or to learn more about this business property insurance, contact us today.Do you own a commercial building? If so, do you have enough commercial property insurance to cover replacement costs? Although cost estimators are available, we recommend that you secure an appraisal from a third party to accurately determine the current replacement cost of your building. Give us a call today, and weâll help you determine if you have enough commercial property insurance for your business.Most commercial property policies exclude flood as a covered cause of loss. A separate policy must be purchased to protect you from resulting damage. Check your current property insurance policy to be sure you are covered. If youâre unsure, just ask us to review your insurance policy, and weâll help you find the best solution.Business personal property insurance covers property at a specified location such as furniture, fixtures, equipment and inventory. Be aware that most commercial property policies have very limited coverage for property taken off the specified location. If you have equipment that is frequently taken off-site to various locations, it is important that you have an inland marine policy (equipment or installation floater).This coverage reimburses a business owner for lost profits and fixed expenses during the time that a business is closed. It applies while the premises are being restored because of damage from an event such as a fire. Business income insurance may also cover financial losses that occur if civil authorities limit customer access to your neighborhood or business after a disaster. We strongly recommend that all businesses acquire this coverage.This coverage is separate property coverage specifically designed to protect your computer related equipment. Most commercial property policies have limited coverage for computer networks. EDP broadens the causes of loss to include things like power surges and in some cases virus attacks.Family Trust understands the Las Vegas business insurance needs of our customers. The right coverage for you is unique â call us today to find out how to protect your business and your future with the right insurance.

      Signup            On Nov. 17, Christopher Rodway, 48, a
          British citizen working in a Saudi hospital, died after a small
          explosion in the capital tore through his car, which was believed to
          have been booby-trapped. Rodway's wife was slightly injured. On Nov.
          22, a bomb exploded in another car in Riyadh, wounding two men and a
          woman, all British workers at an unidentified company.``The source of the explosives and
          many other relevant facts are known to us, but in the interest of the
          investigation we will not disclose them now,'' Prince Nayef said in a
          statement on state-run Saudi television. He did not say when the three
          were arrested.He also said nine others had been
          arrested ``in connection with other crimes, and they are still under
          investigation.'' He did not reveal their nationalities, except to say
          none were Saudis. The statement was vague and it was not clear if
          those arrests were connected to the case of the three Westerners.Prince Nayef said diplomats from the
          three countries have visited the men in custody.A Canadian Foreign Affairs ministry
          spokesman, Oussamah Tamim, said the Canadian, William Sampson, 42, has
          been in custody in Saudi Arabia since November and that consular
          officials visited with him as recently as last week. He said they
          tried to provide them with assistance earlier but were denied
          permission by Saudi authorities.A British Foreign Office spokeswoman
          said Sunday night that she was aware of the broadcast but could not
          confirm whether any of the details were true.``We are currently seeking official
          confirmation of what was alleged,'' she said on condition of
          anonymity.A Belgian foreign ministry spokesman
          declined to comment, saying Belgium does not release the names of
          nationals accused or arrested abroad.Following Prince Nayef's
          announcement, the three men appeared on state-run Saudi television and
          confessed to the bombings. On a street map, they pointed out the
          location of the victims' homes and the blast sites.All three men spoke in English, with
          a voice-over in Arabic. Their names were translated from Arabic, and
          except in Sampson's case, the spellings could not be immediately
          confirmed.The first man identified himself as
          Alexander Mitchell, of Britain. He said that he had received
          instructions to carry out the Nov. 17 bombing with the help of
          Sampson. He did not say who gave the order for the bombing.Mitchell said he planted the
          explosive device on Rodway's car, then that the two men followed the
          victim and his wife to a main thoroughfare where Sampson detonated the
          explosive by remote control.Sampson, who said he worked as a
          marketing consultant, said he was ordered by Mitchell to make
          preparations for the second bombing with the help of a Belgian he
          identified as Raf Schifter.Schifter said he was at Mitchell's
          home and heard a conversation between Mitchell and Sampson about the
          first explosion.Later, Mitchell told him he would
          need his help in the second bombing, Schifter added. He said he
          received an explosive device from Sampson which he was ordered to
          plant on a car parked near his car outside a residential complex. He
          said he followed the car and saw it explode.``I immediately stopped my car behind
          it and helped the wounded people,'' he said. ``What I have said is the
          truth.''

Thursday, June 14, 2007 at 11:15pm by Site AdministratorThe First American Entrepreneur?
Mark Skousen of The Daily Reckoning has a great retrospective of Benjamin Franklin and his positive influence in helping make the US a country of wealth and wealth-mindedness. Note that Skousen has “updated Franklin’s Autobiography for modern times.”Personally, I think of Franklin as a consummate entrepreneur and inventor – a role model to be emulated. I’ve read his Autobiography and a number of other biographies about him, at the same time that I was studying my two other favorite inventors, Thomas Edison and Leonardo da Vinci. Franklin, in addition to being an entrepreneur, was also a diplomat and put in a public effort to educate people.The Entrepreneurial Spirit
Richard Stratton, a British entrepreneur, graduated from business school last year, but became bed-bound recently when he dislocated a hip. But he didn’t let that stop him, and taught himself web design. He ended up creating a website that helps promote other sites at a low cost, while rotating their positioning. While it’s a fairly new site and has only attracted 57 companies/ advertisers, it’s sort of similar in concept to sites like Million Dollar. In other words, it has potential to do well. [via PR Leap]Oprah: Most Powerful Celebrity
While I was watching the news tonight, one clip declared talk show Oprah as the most powerful American celebrity. She earned about US$260M last year. The next closest earner was Tiger Woods, who made less than half that amount. Oprah for President! Why not? She’s probably more qualified and popular than some of the other candidates, and very entrepreneurial besides.

Quotes 
from

Tao 

		Te Ching

The 

		Tao  "The Way"
⃝  The 

		Tao 

			principle is what happens of itself.

		⃝ 

			The Tao is told is not the Tao.

		⃝ 

			The Tao never acts with force, yet there is nothing that it can not 

			do.

		⃝ 

			The great Way is easy, yet people prefer the side paths. Be aware 

			when things are out of

			


balance. Stay centered 

			within the Tao.

		⃝ 

			As it acts in the world, the Tao is like the bending of a bow. The 

			top is bent downward; the bottom is bent up. It adjusts excess and 

			deficiency so that there is perfect

			balance.

		⃝  Tao loves and nourishes all things, but does not dominate it 

			over them.

		⃝ 

			When good thing are accomplished, it does not claim (or name) them. 

			This is 
Te, which is 

			close in meaning to power or virtue. It 

			is something within a person, and it is enhanced by following the

			Tao, or 'that from which nothing can deviate'.

		⃝ 

			When Simplicity is broken up, it is made into instruments. Evolved 

			individuals who employ them, are made into 

		leaders. In this way, the 

			Great System is United.



Living the Tao
 
⃝ 

		Intelligent people know others.

			Enlightened 

			people know themselves.
⃝  The Master observes the world, but trusts his inner vision. He 

			allows things to come and go. His heart is as open as the sky.
⃝  
⃝  Can you 

		step back 

			from your own mind and thus 

			understand all things?

		⃝ 

			When I let go of what I am, I become what I might be.

		⃝ 

		I have just three things to teach: 

			simplicity, patience, 

			compassion. These three are 

			your greatest treasures.

		⃝ 

			No disaster is worse than being 

			discontented.
⃝  

Success is as dangerous as 

			

failure, and we are often our own worst 

			enemy. 
⃝  The journey of 1,000 miles starts with a single step.
⃝  Confront the difficult while it is still easy; 

			accomplish the great task by a series of small acts.
⃝  
When 

			you have accomplished your goal simply walk away. This is the path 

			way to Heaven
⃝  

Love the whole 

			world as if it were your self; then you will truly care for all 

			things. 
⃝  A sage is skilled at

			helping people without excluding anyone.
⃝  
The 

			Master doesn't seek fulfillment. For only those who are not full are 

			able to be used which brings the feeling of completeness.

		⃝ 

			Allow your softer, more 

			intuitive, and less dominating feminine qualities to rise to 

			the fore, so that you're surrendering rather than dominating, 

			receiving rather than broadcasting, loving rather than fighting.
⃝  
That 

			which offers no resistance, overcomes the hardest substances. That which offers no resistance can enter where there is no space.

			Few in the world can comprehend the teaching without words, or understand the value of non-action.
⃝  Can you love or guide someone without any kind of expectation?

		⃝ 

			Nurture the spontaneous peaceful life.

		⃝ 

			Don't impose your will through manipulation of aggressive emotions 

			and actions

		⃝ 

			If you worry more for others' beliefs, then you will be their slave.
⃝  
There is no greater transgression than condoning peoples selfish 

			desires, no greater disaster than being discontent, and no greater 

			retribution than for greed. 
⃝  Rule your mind with serenity rather than with force and 

			manipulation.

		⃝ 

			Approach your own inner life with a

			loving quality that accepts who you are without trying to change 

			who you are.

		⃝ 

			Having reached a high level of realization (or having accomplished 

			anything in life), don't get excited or puffed up with pride but 

			remain calm, humble, and in "perfect equanimity" if you want to 

			continue in this deep state of consciousness.  

		
About Lao Tzu
Lao 

	Tzu was born in app. 500 BC, in southern China in the state of Ch'u, now 

	known as the Hunan Province. Almost nothing is known about Lao Tzu apart 

	from what can be gleaned from the legends that surround his name. His book 

	of spiritual reflections called the Tao Te Ching (The Way 

	 Virtue  Progress) has been 

	published in more languages than any book except the Bible.1
For at least fifty years, Lao Tzu worked in the 

	emperor's library, kept mostly to himself, and was considered a recluse and 

	a mystic of deep wisdom. To our knowledge, all during his long tenure at the 

	Imperial Archives Lao Tzu wrote no books, nor did he allow any disciples to 

	gather around him. 
Lao Tzu 

	and Confucius




→


Confucius, the venerable philosopher who was born a generation after 

	Lao Tzu, once sought out Lao Tzu for an interview, during which Lao Tzu told 

	the soon-to-be-famous philosopher and moralist: "Strip yourself of your 

	proud airs and numerous desires, your complacent demeanor and excessive 

	ambitions. They won't do you any good. This is all I have to say you." 

	Following this now-famous interview with the old man, young 

	Confucius said 

	to his disciples, "I don't know how dragons can ride upon the wind and 

	clouds and soar to high heaven. I saw Lao Tzu today. He can be likened to a 

	dragon."1
Life 

	Style
Lao Tzu lived a simple contemplative life in 

	which he learned step by step by step how to practice what he understood to 

	be "the Way" or "the Path"  or in Chinese, the

	

	Tao. Throughout his life, "he walked his walk but didn't much talk 

	any talk."1
  




Those who 

			know don't talk, 


those who talk don't know.

According to Henry Way2, "Lao Tzu 

	may rightly be regarded as an immortal inspirer. His teachings constitute a 

	bright beacon for the guidance of the human spirit to supreme fulfillment... 

	He led a long, quiet and studious life and then vanished from the human 

	scene, leaving behind a compact parcel of sublime wisdom in glorious 

	poetry... He was not exactly a hermit or recluse, but simply loved the 

	contemplative life. He preferred to stay in obscurity in the silence of the 

	library, devoting himself to inner culture and the pursuit of truth, living 

	with serene spontaneity and natural ease."2   
  



Embrace 

			simplicity. Put others first. Desire little.



Lao Tzu
         

	
 
The Book Tao Te Chin
Lao Tzu wrote his only book Tao Te Ching 

	just before he walked away from the Chou empire he served. One day the old 

	man decided to take his leave of the city and simply started walking towards 

	the distant mountain pass. "Arriving at the gate leading out of the Chou 

	empire, he was halted by the keeper of the border, a man named Yin Hsi, who 

	asked him, "Before you retire entirely from the world, will you please write 

	some words for our enlightenment?" Lao Tzu obviously agreed, because before 

	he walked out through the gates and disappeared into anther kingdom and 

	who-knows-what personal life experience, he left with Yin Hsi a slender 

	collection of eighty-one short poems and reflections, consisting in total of 

	only around five thousand words."1
  




If you can 

			find true contentment, 

			

it will last forever.

Health maintenance organizations (HMO) delimit patient access to primary care by member-physicians, while with preferred provider organizations (PPO), such exclusivity does not exist.

By Scott Kirsner, Globe ColumnistI was told by an individual close to the deal that the purchase price was roughly $135 million in cash, and that's what other outlets have been reporting today. (The company had raised about $20 million in venture capital since being founded as uLocate in 2004.) Where Inc. executives say that the company will maintain an office in Boston, and will likely add to its current employee count of 120. Doyle says the company grew from 30 employees to 120 over the past 18 months.Where Inc. had originally tried to sell a service that would enable family members to get information about one another's location using their mobile devices; more recently, it has been focused on operating an advertising network that reaches mobile phone users, and promoting its own mobile app to help consumers find relevant businesses around them (and also potentially delivering discounts.) Doyle is the company's third CEO."This is a very strategic acquisition by eBay," says Charley Lax, managing partner at Grand Banks Capital in Wellesley, which originally incubated the start-up in its offices. "This is a company that was at the dance with a lot of people over the years," Lax says, suggesting that several other players had made attempts to acquire the company. Lax told me that the $135 million purchase figure was wrong, but he wouldn't say whether it was high or low."We just don't disclose any terms of the deal," says eBay spokesperson Kathy Chui.PayPal executive Amanda Pines explained the acquisition this way in a blog post this morning:Where CEO Doyle says that the company will be focused going forward on using its mobile app to "drive foot traffic to merchants," and presumably using PayPal to consummate transactions. "It's about frictionless and contextual commerce for the consumer," Doyle says. He says he'll remain in Boston, rather than moving to PayPal's San Jose headquarters: "This is all about Boston. I lived out west for eight years. I did my Valley time."Boston has seen a string of five major mobile acquisitions over the past few years, Doyle notes, including Apple buying Quattro Wireless for $275 million and VeriSign buying m-Qube for $250 million. "Boston is a tremendous hub for mobile development," Doyle says. (I'd ask: is "hub" the right term, or "shopping mall for big tech players"?)Here's PayPal's blog post on the deal, along with coverage from Mass High Tech, TechCrunch, and BostInnovation.eBay's most recent prior purchase in the Boston area took place in 2003, when the company bought the assets of the publicly-traded auction site FairMarket for $4.5 million in cash; that company's Web site no longer exists, and the phone number no longer works. eBay also picked up Boston-based "flash sale" site Rue La La last month, as part of an acquisition of GSI Commerce, but eBay plans to spin that company out again.

The company gave an assurance in this regard to a delegation of Tamil Nadu officials, which visited China last week, according to a senior government official.The delegation was led by Tamil Nadu deputy chief minister M K Stalin. The state government had earlier said that it was expecting investments to the tune of around RsÂ  3,000 crore (Rs 30 billion) from China and Korea in the next two years, which would generate around 10,000 direct and indirect jobs. Speaking to Business Standard on the sidelines of TPM national conference, organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry, state industries secretary Rajeev Ranjan said, "We have met the management (of Huawei) and they confirmed that they propose to invest in the state to set up a telecom equipment manufacturing facility."Skills training programmeRanjan said that the state government had taken up an integrated skills development scheme aimed at providing training to over 100,000 people in the next six months. The government has identified 15 sectors like (mainly sub sectors of manufacturing), leather, automotive and chemical."The government has allocated RsÂ  50 crore for the programme, which will be taken up as a pilot. We will extend our support by giving RsÂ  6,000 per person," Ranjan said.The training would be provided through government institutions like power loom and weavers service centres and textiles research associations, and apparel training and design centres. Â The scheme would be implemented mostly through government agencies and the rest through private-public partnership model.Ranjan said that the state had 456 colleges and 130,000 engineering students were passing out from these colleges every year. "Whether they are employable is the issue. To fill this gap and to support the industry, we have decided to take up this programme," he added.

          sorry to say that Aardvark Business has now closed.It's 
          been a pleasure running it for over 8 years but sadly all things have 
          to come to an end. Paul, who is the person initially behind the site, 
          now has too many commitments that he no longer has the resources to 
          continue to manage the Aardvark websites.Of 
          all the Aardvark websites, Aardvark Travel was by far the most popular 
          and those of you who enjoyed engaging in the regular travel discussions

Outside of China, similar customs exist across parts of South East Asia and many other countries with a sizable ethnic Chinese population.Red envelopes are gifts presented at social and family gatherings such as weddings or holidays such as Chinese New Year. The red color of the envelope symbolizes good luck and is a symbol to ward off evil spirits. The act of requesting red packets is normally called tao hongbao (Chinese: è¨ç´å; pinyin: tÇo hÃ³ngbÄo) or yao lishi (Chinese: è¦å©æ¯; pinyin: yÃ o lÃ¬ shÃ¬), and in the south of China, lai see (Chinese: éå©æ¯; pinyin: dÃ²u lÃ¬ shÃ¬; Cantonese Yale: dau6 lai6 si6). Red envelopes are usually given out by married couples to single people, regardless of age, or by older to younger ones during holidays and festivals.Related Tags : 1Adress: No 122,XianWu Industrial Park Guanlan Street,Longhua District,Shenzhen+86-755-2908576113444159305Copyright Â© 2019 Darshan Color World Industrial(HK) Limited.All Rights Reserved.

In 2016 and 2015, acquisitions were not significant.Acquisitions of controlling interests have been accounted for under the acquisition method and have been included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of acquisition.While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, the purchase price allocation for acquisitions is preliminary for up to 12 months after the acquisition date and is subject to refinement as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information about the fair values of the assets and liabilities becomes available.On July 6, 2017, the Company acquired the shares of B&R, a worldwide provider of product- and software-based, open-architecture solutions for machine and factory automation. This acquisition closes a gap in the Company’s industrial automation portfolio and consequently the goodwill acquired represents the future benefits associated with product portfolio expansion.The aggregate preliminary allocation of the purchase consideration for business acquisitions in 2017, was as follows:(XLS:) Download Excel($ in millions)Allocated amountsWeighted-average useful life(1)The Company does not expect the goodwill recognized to be deductible for income tax purposes.(2)Primarily relates to the acquisition of B&R.Technology4347 yearsCustomer Relationships29219 yearsTrade names6510 yearsOrder backlog13 monthsIntangible assets792 Fixed assets131 Debt acquired(50) Deferred tax liabilities(255) Inventories177 Other assets and liabilities, net(21) Goodwill(1)1,337 Total consideration (net of cash acquired)(2)2,111 In 2017, the Company received proceeds (net of transaction costs and cash disposed) of $605 million, relating to divestments of consolidated businesses and recorded net gains of $252 million in “Other income (expense), net” on the sale of such businesses. These are primarily due to the divestment of the Company’s high-voltage cables and cable accessories businesses (the Cables business) in March 2017 and the divestment of the Oil & Gas EPC business in December 2017.The Company has retained certain obligations of the Cables business and thus the Company remains directly or indirectly liable for these liabilities which existed at the date of the divestment. Subsequent to the divestment, the Company recorded a loss of $94 million for changes in the amounts recorded for these obligations. In addition, the Company has provided certain performance guarantees to third parties which guarantee the performance of the buyer under existing contracts with customers as well as for certain capital expenditures of the divested business.In 2016 and 2015, there were no significant amounts recognized from divestments of consolidated businesses.On September 25, 2017, the Company announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire General Electric Company’s (GE) Industrial Solutions business, GE’s global electrification solutions business, for $2.6 billion. The Company expects to close the acquisition of GE Industrial Solutions in the first half of 2018, following the receipt of customary regulatory approvals.Business Bulletin 1999-2011Minutes of Proceedings 1999-2011Journal of Parliamentary Proceedings Sessions 1 & 2 Committees Sessions 1, 2 & 3 Annual reportsThe sections which appear in today’s Business Bulletin are in bold Section A: 		Today’s Business-	Meetings of Committees-	Meeting of the ParliamentSection B: Future Meetings of the ParliamentSection C: Future Meetings of CommitteesSection D: Oral Questions-	Questions selected for First Minister’s Question Time -	Questions selected for response by Ministers and junior Scottish Ministers at Question TimeSection E: Written Questions – new questions for written answer Section F: Motions and Amendments Section G: Bills-	New Bills introduced-	New amendments to Bills-	Members’ Bills proposalsSection H: New Documents – new documents laid before the Parliament and committee reports publishedSection I: Petitions – new public petitions Section J: Progress of Legislation – progress of Bills and subordinate legislationThis section is from the book "Handbook Of The Law Of Contracts", by Wm.

At common law, upon a woman's marriage the right to reduce her choses in action into possession is transferred to her husband, and he becomes liable jointly with her. during coverture, upon her antenuptial contracts. These rules are changed by statute in most jurisdictions.At common law, a married woman is disabled from acquiring the benefits of her antenuptial contract, because she cannot sue upon it apart from her husband, and she may lose them altogether, for they are vested conditionally in the husband, who may take them to himself by reduction into possession of the chose in action. He may also sue jointly with his wife for what is due on her contracts. Whatever is thus obtained passes absolutely to him.' If the husband does not thus reduce his wife's choses in action into his possession, they survive to her if he dies first, or pass to her representatives if she dies in his lifetime.N.

By Kate Faulkner, Managing Director at Designs on Property in For Landlords.With a new government in place, both the property industry and tenant and landlord groups and organisations will be keen to promote their ideas and thoughts about changes to the Private Rented Sector that would help the market work better for everyone involved.Earlier this year, I produced a comprehensive report on the Private Rented Sector (PRS), which looked at how the market worked from the various perspectives of an agent, a landlord and, of course, a tenant.Interestingly, my conclusion was that most of the PRS works really well. According to a government report, around 78% of landlords have just one property*, so they aren’t the ‘career’ landlords who are often accused of trying to squeeze
  every penny they can out of tenants.Most landlords just want to let a decent property at a fair rent and many hope that if the tenant is a good one, they will stay for a long time. This is great news for tenants, as one of the ways landlords always aim to keep the best tenants is by not
  increasing the rent unless they have to.Nationally, rent inflation for existing tenants in the same property is extremely low; the downside for tenants being that they often suddenly have to pay a lot more when they eventually move to another property - as will the new tenants that take on
  the existing property.In my view, the PRS needs some changes to make it better for all, but most of these are easy to implement and don’t require huge amounts of government intervention.One of the major problems is that many landlords and tenants don’t consider whether a property is legally let – or even know what the requirements are.I would like to see the government publish a clear list of 15 major checks that any landlord and tenant should make on a property. Steps have already been taken, with their ‘How to Rent’ Guide (link: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-rent).Next, although all letting agents now have to be a member of an Ombudsman, so that landlords and tenants have access to a free complaints procedure, I don’t think this is enough. No letting agent should be holding rent without Client Money Protection insurance,
  which means if something goes wrong in the business, the rent money is protected.More needs to be done to encourage landlords to keep the PRS well stocked with good-quality accommodation. Unnecessary rent controls could put people off investing in much needed rental stock, and taxation must be such
  that it motivates landlords to keep their property in good condition.One of the big frustrations for all good landlords and letting agents is that there is little enforcement of the rules and regulations – and this can lead to the ‘good guys’ losing business to rogues. We have to be able to easily
  identify at a local level which properties are privately rented and where licensing landlords won’t help, as only the good will apply! A great idea from the Residential Landlords Association was a tick box on council tax forms  that are filled in by tenants, to say a property is rented.Once local authorities can identify rented properties and agents, they can better ensure they are operating legally and do so cost effectively, or get help from other sources. For example, Shelter are planning to launch a pilot scheme
  in Dundee later this year that will support the local authority with a ‘private renting support officer’ whose job will be to help landlords ensure they’re operating legally.Secondly, from an enforcement perspective, there is little or no funding for new regulations to be promoted when they are introduced – let alone enforced. And if local authorities do fine landlords or agents, they don’t necessarily plough
  that money back into more enforcement, which would seem to be the sensible thing.So, monies need to be made available to educate and enforce existing and new letting laws.Bringing out rules and regulations one after another is increasing the cost of providing a good lettings service for landlords and agents. Both on and off-line there is a huge amount of misinformation and some of the rules, for example electrical safety,
  are ambiguous and need to be clarified.To keep up with the latest rules and regulations, mandatory CPD training is needed for all of the PRS – including lenders, insurers, housing charities/organisations and housing associations, as well as landlords and letting agents.
  And from a tenant perspective, many young people will now rent rather than buy, so adding ‘how to rent’ to the national curriculum would be really helpful to the next generation.The full report is available at Propertychecklists.co.uk  *https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/7249/2010380.pdf

Home - About Us - Contact Us - Legal & Terms of Use - Truckers' Savings Blog - Free NewsletterBy Scott Kirsner, Globe ColumnistI was told by an individual close to the deal that the purchase price was roughly $135 million in cash, and that's what other outlets have been reporting today. (The company had raised about $20 million in venture capital since being founded as uLocate in 2004.) Where Inc. executives say that the company will maintain an office in Boston, and will likely add to its current employee count of 120. Doyle says the company grew from 30 employees to 120 over the past 18 months.Where Inc. had originally tried to sell a service that would enable family members to get information about one another's location using their mobile devices; more recently, it has been focused on operating an advertising network that reaches mobile phone users, and promoting its own mobile app to help consumers find relevant businesses around them (and also potentially delivering discounts.) Doyle is the company's third CEO."This is a very strategic acquisition by eBay," says Charley Lax, managing partner at Grand Banks Capital in Wellesley, which originally incubated the start-up in its offices. "This is a company that was at the dance with a lot of people over the years," Lax says, suggesting that several other players had made attempts to acquire the company. Lax told me that the $135 million purchase figure was wrong, but he wouldn't say whether it was high or low."We just don't disclose any terms of the deal," says eBay spokesperson Kathy Chui.PayPal executive Amanda Pines explained the acquisition this way in a blog post this morning:Where CEO Doyle says that the company will be focused going forward on using its mobile app to "drive foot traffic to merchants," and presumably using PayPal to consummate transactions. "It's about frictionless and contextual commerce for the consumer," Doyle says. He says he'll remain in Boston, rather than moving to PayPal's San Jose headquarters: "This is all about Boston. I lived out west for eight years. I did my Valley time."Boston has seen a string of five major mobile acquisitions over the past few years, Doyle notes, including Apple buying Quattro Wireless for $275 million and VeriSign buying m-Qube for $250 million. "Boston is a tremendous hub for mobile development," Doyle says. (I'd ask: is "hub" the right term, or "shopping mall for big tech players"?)Here's PayPal's blog post on the deal, along with coverage from Mass High Tech, TechCrunch, and BostInnovation.eBay's most recent prior purchase in the Boston area took place in 2003, when the company bought the assets of the publicly-traded auction site FairMarket for $4.5 million in cash; that company's Web site no longer exists, and the phone number no longer works. eBay also picked up Boston-based "flash sale" site Rue La La last month, as part of an acquisition of GSI Commerce, but eBay plans to spin that company out again.

The company gave an assurance in this regard to a delegation of Tamil Nadu officials, which visited China last week, according to a senior government official.The delegation was led by Tamil Nadu deputy chief minister M K Stalin. The state government had earlier said that it was expecting investments to the tune of around RsÂ  3,000 crore (Rs 30 billion) from China and Korea in the next two years, which would generate around 10,000 direct and indirect jobs. Speaking to Business Standard on the sidelines of TPM national conference, organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry, state industries secretary Rajeev Ranjan said, "We have met the management (of Huawei) and they confirmed that they propose to invest in the state to set up a telecom equipment manufacturing facility."Skills training programmeRanjan said that the state government had taken up an integrated skills development scheme aimed at providing training to over 100,000 people in the next six months. The government has identified 15 sectors like (mainly sub sectors of manufacturing), leather, automotive and chemical."The government has allocated RsÂ  50 crore for the programme, which will be taken up as a pilot. We will extend our support by giving RsÂ  6,000 per person," Ranjan said.The training would be provided through government institutions like power loom and weavers service centres and textiles research associations, and apparel training and design centres. Â The scheme would be implemented mostly through government agencies and the rest through private-public partnership model.Ranjan said that the state had 456 colleges and 130,000 engineering students were passing out from these colleges every year. "Whether they are employable is the issue. To fill this gap and to support the industry, we have decided to take up this programme," he added. Moneywiz Live!ï»¿

Outside of China, similar customs exist across parts of South East Asia and many other countries with a sizable ethnic Chinese population.Red envelopes are gifts presented at social and family gatherings such as weddings or holidays such as Chinese New Year. The red color of the envelope symbolizes good luck and is a symbol to ward off evil spirits. The act of requesting red packets is normally called tao hongbao (Chinese: è¨ç´å; pinyin: tÇo hÃ³ngbÄo) or yao lishi (Chinese: è¦å©æ¯; pinyin: yÃ o lÃ¬ shÃ¬), and in the south of China, lai see (Chinese: éå©æ¯; pinyin: dÃ²u lÃ¬ shÃ¬; Cantonese Yale: dau6 lai6 si6). Red envelopes are usually given out by married couples to single people, regardless of age, or by older to younger ones during holidays and festivals.Related Tags : 1Adress: No 122,XianWu Industrial Park Guanlan Street,Longhua District,Shenzhen+86-755-2908576113444159305Copyright Â© 2019 Darshan Color World Industrial(HK) Limited.All Rights Reserved.

This acquisition closes a gap in the Company’s industrial automation portfolio and consequently the goodwill acquired represents the future benefits associated with product portfolio expansion.The aggregate preliminary allocation of the purchase consideration for business acquisitions in 2017, was as follows:(XLS:) Download Excel($ in millions)Allocated amountsWeighted-average useful life(1)The Company does not expect the goodwill recognized to be deductible for income tax purposes.(2)Primarily relates to the acquisition of B&R.Technology4347 yearsCustomer Relationships29219 yearsTrade names6510 yearsOrder backlog13 monthsIntangible assets792 Fixed assets131 Debt acquired(50) Deferred tax liabilities(255) Inventories177 Other assets and liabilities, net(21) Goodwill(1)1,337 Total consideration (net of cash acquired)(2)2,111 In 2017, the Company received proceeds (net of transaction costs and cash disposed) of $605 million, relating to divestments of consolidated businesses and recorded net gains of $252 million in “Other income (expense), net” on the sale of such businesses. These are primarily due to the divestment of the Company’s high-voltage cables and cable accessories businesses (the Cables business) in March 2017 and the divestment of the Oil & Gas EPC business in December 2017.The Company has retained certain obligations of the Cables business and thus the Company remains directly or indirectly liable for these liabilities which existed at the date of the divestment. Subsequent to the divestment, the Company recorded a loss of $94 million for changes in the amounts recorded for these obligations. In addition, the Company has provided certain performance guarantees to third parties which guarantee the performance of the buyer under existing contracts with customers as well as for certain capital expenditures of the divested business.In 2016 and 2015, there were no significant amounts recognized from divestments of consolidated businesses.On September 25, 2017, the Company announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire General Electric Company’s (GE) Industrial Solutions business, GE’s global electrification solutions business, for $2.6 billion. The Company expects to close the acquisition of GE Industrial Solutions in the first half of 2018, following the receipt of customary regulatory approvals.Business Bulletin 1999-2011Minutes of Proceedings 1999-2011Journal of Parliamentary Proceedings Sessions 1 & 2 Committees Sessions 1, 2 & 3 Annual reportsThe sections which appear in today’s Business Bulletin are in bold Section A: 		Today’s Business-	Meetings of Committees-	Meeting of the ParliamentSection B: Future Meetings of the ParliamentSection C: Future Meetings of CommitteesSection D: Oral Questions-	Questions selected for First Minister’s Question Time -	Questions selected for response by Ministers and junior Scottish Ministers at Question TimeSection E: Written Questions – new questions for written answer Section F: Motions and Amendments Section G: Bills-	New Bills introduced-	New amendments to Bills-	Members’ Bills proposalsSection H: New Documents – new documents laid before the Parliament and committee reports publishedSection I: Petitions – new public petitions Section J: Progress of Legislation – progress of Bills and subordinate legislationThis section is from the book "Handbook Of The Law Of Contracts", by Wm.

At common law, upon a woman's marriage the right to reduce her choses in action into possession is transferred to her husband, and he becomes liable jointly with her. during coverture, upon her antenuptial contracts. These rules are changed by statute in most jurisdictions.At common law, a married woman is disabled from acquiring the benefits of her antenuptial contract, because she cannot sue upon it apart from her husband, and she may lose them altogether, for they are vested conditionally in the husband, who may take them to himself by reduction into possession of the chose in action. He may also sue jointly with his wife for what is due on her contracts. Whatever is thus obtained passes absolutely to him.' If the husband does not thus reduce his wife's choses in action into his possession, they survive to her if he dies first, or pass to her representatives if she dies in his lifetime.N.

By Kate Faulkner, Managing Director at Designs on Property in For Landlords.With a new government in place, both the property industry and tenant and landlord groups and organisations will be keen to promote their ideas and thoughts about changes to the Private Rented Sector that would help the market work better for everyone involved.Earlier this year, I produced a comprehensive report on the Private Rented Sector (PRS), which looked at how the market worked from the various perspectives of an agent, a landlord and, of course, a tenant.Interestingly, my conclusion was that most of the PRS works really well. According to a government report, around 78% of landlords have just one property*, so they aren’t the ‘career’ landlords who are often accused of trying to squeeze
  every penny they can out of tenants.Most landlords just want to let a decent property at a fair rent and many hope that if the tenant is a good one, they will stay for a long time. This is great news for tenants, as one of the ways landlords always aim to keep the best tenants is by not
  increasing the rent unless they have to.Nationally, rent inflation for existing tenants in the same property is extremely low; the downside for tenants being that they often suddenly have to pay a lot more when they eventually move to another property - as will the new tenants that take on
  the existing property.In my view, the PRS needs some changes to make it better for all, but most of these are easy to implement and don’t require huge amounts of government intervention.One of the major problems is that many landlords and tenants don’t consider whether a property is legally let – or even know what the requirements are.I would like to see the government publish a clear list of 15 major checks that any landlord and tenant should make on a property. Steps have already been taken, with their ‘How to Rent’ Guide (link: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-rent).Next, although all letting agents now have to be a member of an Ombudsman, so that landlords and tenants have access to a free complaints procedure, I don’t think this is enough. No letting agent should be holding rent without Client Money Protection insurance,
  which means if something goes wrong in the business, the rent money is protected.More needs to be done to encourage landlords to keep the PRS well stocked with good-quality accommodation. Unnecessary rent controls could put people off investing in much needed rental stock, and taxation must be such
  that it motivates landlords to keep their property in good condition.One of the big frustrations for all good landlords and letting agents is that there is little enforcement of the rules and regulations – and this can lead to the ‘good guys’ losing business to rogues. We have to be able to easily
  identify at a local level which properties are privately rented and where licensing landlords won’t help, as only the good will apply! A great idea from the Residential Landlords Association was a tick box on council tax forms  that are filled in by tenants, to say a property is rented.Once local authorities can identify rented properties and agents, they can better ensure they are operating legally and do so cost effectively, or get help from other sources. For example, Shelter are planning to launch a pilot scheme
  in Dundee later this year that will support the local authority with a ‘private renting support officer’ whose job will be to help landlords ensure they’re operating legally.Secondly, from an enforcement perspective, there is little or no funding for new regulations to be promoted when they are introduced – let alone enforced. And if local authorities do fine landlords or agents, they don’t necessarily plough
  that money back into more enforcement, which would seem to be the sensible thing.So, monies need to be made available to educate and enforce existing and new letting laws.Bringing out rules and regulations one after another is increasing the cost of providing a good lettings service for landlords and agents. Both on and off-line there is a huge amount of misinformation and some of the rules, for example electrical safety,
  are ambiguous and need to be clarified.To keep up with the latest rules and regulations, mandatory CPD training is needed for all of the PRS – including lenders, insurers, housing charities/organisations and housing associations, as well as landlords and letting agents.
  And from a tenant perspective, many young people will now rent rather than buy, so adding ‘how to rent’ to the national curriculum would be really helpful to the next generation.The full report is available at Propertychecklists.co.uk  *https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/7249/2010380.pdf

(TSX-V: SNN) ("Sintana" or the "Company") announces that it has been notified by the Operator of the Talora Block that the Dorados-1X exploration well commenced drilling operations on July 31, 2012.The Company previously announced an agreement with Petrodorado Energy Ltd. (TSX-V: PDQ) to farm-in for an undivided 30% interest in the 58,570 acre Talora Block located in Colombia's prolific Magdalena Basin. The Talora Block, which is operated by Petrodorado, is immediately adjacent to the region's main oil and gas pipelines and only 60 kilometers west of the capital city of Bogota.  Given this close proximity to infrastructure, conversion of a discovery to a commercial well is expected to be a relatively quick process.The well, which is targeting the Cretaceous Caballos and Tetuan formations, is presently drilling ahead at a depth of 2,500 feet to a planned total depth of 9,500 feet. The Company will earn a 30% private participation interest in the well by paying 60% of the well costs, subject to a cap of US$6.5 Million (gross). Costs above the cap are to be paid proportionally by each partner based on their respective participation interests.In Peru, planning has commenced for a seismic program on Bayovar Block XXVII (Sintana â 25%), located in the Sechura Basin.  Faulkner Exploration, as operator, previously drilled the SC-4X seismic control well.  Open hole log data from the well is being incorporated into the design of the seismic shoot.  Post processing and analysis, optimum locations for subsequent wells will be selected based on this seismic. The SC 4X control well reached a TD of 5,276 feet and encountered the target reservoirs 500 feet lower than anticipated.  Open hole log evaluations identified a continuous column of rich gas shows from the 1,496 feet of gross Paleozoic section penetrated, starting at 3,780 feet.  Imagery logs depict a high density fracture system with a network of fracture intersections. The Operator reported that during testing the highly fractured target interval collapsed which prevented completion of the well. The objective of gathering open hole log data on the stratigraphic section on the block was achieved and indications of hydrocarbons at this location are considered a significant bonus.Doug Manner, CEO of Sintana commented "We are excited about commencing the Talora exploration drilling program and look forward to completing the seismic program at Bayovar. We anticipate having drilling results for the Dorados-1X well in September."

				M15 6SEdigitalenergy professional is a unique cloud based energy management system that helps organisations manage their building energy portfolio by reducing costs, resources and compliance risks.It is the only system that incorporates the entire range of tasks within an energy estate, from monitoring and targeting, right through to compliance audits and evidence trails.digitalenergy professional is a unique "one system for all" energy management software platform that can be accessed at different levels across diverse asset portfolios.Onscreen interfaces, dashboards and reports are equally accessible through desktop, laptop, tablet or mobile devices.Focus your stakeholder engagement on reducing costs, reducing carbon, whilst at the same time safeguarding your organisation against compliance legislation.Accurate data and utility bill management has long been an area of concern for energy consumers. Inaccurate invoices place a substantial cost burden on energy users yet many customers do not have the time or resource to resolve billing issues themselves.Switching suppliers can also lead to incorrect data input and consumption data is frequently estimated, with some companies having meters read as little as once a year. digitalenergy professional can be used for full invoice checking and bill validation in a pre or post payment process. Invoices are compared against a calculation of the correct charges that should have been applied according to the supply contracts currently in place and variances reported to the tolerances that you desire – allowing a small margin for error or down to the last penny! The validation cycle can be configured through an easy to use interface to check against: ·         Ownership and address validations·         Ensuring correct sites are billed.·         MPAN/MPRN and Serial Numbers·         Half Hourly Data (HHD)/meter read consistency.·         Missing invoices/meters.·         Estimated/actual meter read frequency·         The accuracy of billing dates.·         Transportation charges and reconciliations·         Triad charges and reconciliations·         All unit rates and charges (supplier contract).·         All published rates and charges (DuOS/TuOS)           : Launching September 2016·         Tax allocation (CCL and VAT) The system also has a powerful query manager to enable you to log actions taken to resolve issues with suppliers, data collectors or brokers. If you have tenants you can also take advantaged of the reporting system for automated recharging from validated data. High energy consuming public and private sector organisations have a requirement to demonstrate compliance to the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme to improve energy efficiency and cut carbon dioxide emissions.The CRC Management application will enable organisations to manage compliance throughout their CRC phases:·        Collate and calculate carbon footprint data at building level·        View carbon emissions generated by month and year·        Set and manage annual carbon reduction targets and cost savings·        Carbon and energy consumption reports·        Upload and maintain documentation for CRC evidence pack·        Analyse and compare year on year carbon footprints·        Reporting deadline timeline to manage progress through CRC phases User Benefits include:·        Saves time and resources for multisites, by managing CRC online in one system·        Instant access to reports and documentation required for CRC audit evidence packs·        Removes the risk of errors in data and time consuming paper based methods·        An efficient way to achieve year on year reduction in carbon emissionsdigitalenergy professional solves the problem of ‘lack of awareness’ evident in many organisations by allowing access to different types of user across your business. Whether it’s your accounts team needing to see invoice, supplier and cost information or a director requiring a simple but clear picture of organisational consumption and spend, there’s a meaningful view for everyone.Energy Updates sent via e-mail are also a useful tool and digitalenergy can even take this a step further by placing dashboards in high footfall areas within your business to ensure energy awareness extends to as many people as possible. Manchester Science Park

 I am an experienced psychiatrist with 40 years of very full-time practice behind me. During my training we were encouraged to undergo psychoanalysis which I did faithfully for 15 years, four times a week. Over the last 10 years family problems have caused me to seek out supportive psychological help with various therapists with substantial degrees.



		
Despite all this "treatment," it wasn't until I found Susana Sori that I really began to change. Her insights, knowledge, and warmth have helped me grow. I never even realized before the dimensions in my life that were missing until she began enlightening me. I began to understand that the challenges I was facing were there so that I could change and grow.



		
Her energy work is astounding. I have never met Susana face to face (we do our work over the telephone), but I feel that she is one of the closest people in my life. She understands me and my issues immediately and always has a new path to help me. As a psychiatrists, I have prescribed medication and traditional psychoanalytic and supportive psychotherapy to thousands of patients. What Susana does is a higher elevation of my traditional work.



		
I heartily recommend her to all souls in trouble or those who want to enlighten themselves.

Sharings resulting from First Session with Susana 

		SorÃ­I wanted to let you know that the first impression I had, once left the session with you, was an increased sense of my inner intuition about even the simplest things. For example: on my way back home from your place, instead of checking on the map or trying to remember with my mind my way back (as I would have done in the past, fearing to get lost) I followed my intuition, as if some "higher" power inside me was driving me. I can count many other examples like this!

    Thanks!

    
A. from Miami, Florida



    
Since my session with you, which gave me great awareness and clarity on my life at this time, people around me immediately began behaving differently. One quality that stands out, is that people I've known for a while, all of a sudden have really trusted me about their intimate thoughts and emotions.

    After our session, when I returned to work, one of my co-workers jokingly asked me if I had been smoking pot in the park. When I asked why she asked me that she said, 'Because you seem so happy.' The session apparently had quite an effect on me.

Sharings resulting from Individual Sessions with Susana SorÃ­



    Thank you for assisting me to 

        fulfill my dream. I really can feel the shift going on inside and just 

        more and more opportunities seem to be presenting themselves.

        S.L., Boston South Shore, MA


        My session with Susana was an experience with my true self. A lot of emotions that I carried deep inside were released and channeled properly to allow growth and regain confidence. She made me feel at home with myself since the very beginning and helped me see and confront what was stopping me to be in peace and grateful. She gives you a new beginning built upon your own strength.

    Your sessions have worked wonders on my husband. He is a new man. He is exercising almost everyday and can communicate better with our son. It is truly amazing...just thought you would like to know!

I have always found your sessions amazing, yet I now am beginning to understand why I have felt the process so much more deeply lately...You get to the root of core problems and your sessions are so powerful but in an almost gentle way...I just want to say thank you. I love "Susana style". I think that must be it, you put your whole being into it!

    Thank you so much for helping me mend my broken heart! 
S. K., Chicago, IL



    
Although I had my career in mind when signing up for the session, the result has been that my whole life has shifted. No small change, either...from nothing, to more opportunities that I can handle! Yes, it is a good thing!

    After our couple session, I somehow see my wife more clearly and thus more lovingly. I am looking forward to more experiences of this kind. Thank you! B.N., Houston, TX



    
I have been busy this past week and certainly did not have the session on my mind, yet, I found myself feeling grateful on several occasions. And, although I had to do some 'fearful' things, like speak my truth to my partner and express my feelings more, I felt I was supported and I could do them! The result has been that our love life has expanded and I feel much closer to my wife on many levels. We want to let you know that we appreciate all the wisdom, energy and love you gave us.

A huge 'thank you' for providing such a safe, nurturing and supportive environment. It has been an amazing experience!

    	
Couple in Massachusetts 

Sharings from 

        Group Sessions 'by proxy', or 

		'Long Distance' 
As my session with Susana, was done by proxy, I had no expectations I just knew that I was drawn to Susana's proxy workshop. The connection by proxy was deep and profound although non-invasive, upon reading my session report I was able to validate my experience with the experience of others in my group - I have never felt so strongly connected to what I read in the report, at the moment I am still speechless or as we say 'god-smacked' by the strength of the connection. - My session has left me with a profound sense of inner peace and personal freedom, I am looking forward to working with Susana again by proxy. Much appreciated and much love,

A raise I requested back in October has been approved, retroactive back to October; I accepted a job with more money and I am paying attention to savings/tax/retirement issues. I find it somewhat hard to believe that all these changes are really occurring during this workshop!

    	
P. P., Boston, MA



    
Many of my old patterns cleared and I have begun to feel a sense of normality that I have not felt in years. I have chosen to walk the road to financial wealth. The moment I made this choice I was invited and paid to do the work I love. A great blessing!

    H. W., Lexington, MA



    This course is remarkable. I am feeling the effects as we move along. This course taps the root of my core issues."

		
J. K., Ft. Lauderdale, FL



    
The results of the series have been splendid. I experience a greater monthly income for half the work I did before.

        
B. C., Miami FL



    
I am continually grateful that early on in this course we organized and reviewed our finances. The big shift for me is that I no longer have FEAR or JUDGMENT around this. In fact, I now have absolute FAITH. Great job, Susana. This was definitely transformative and needed all the attention we gave it. Thank you for all the attention, skill, genius and love that you gave us - immense!

There are several credit information companies (CICs), such as Transunion, Equifax, Experian and CRIF High Mark, that provide the lending institutions with an individualâs credit score and credit report. Therefore, it is important for everyone to know the following things - what is a credit report, how is a credit report made, what is a credit score, and how to check the credit score. These are important to know even if you do not want to apply for loans or credit cards today. A good credit score will ensure that you have access to loans and credit cards from banks whenever you require themFirstly, the rules ensure that any person can get their credit report and credit score from the credit agencies by visiting their websites and requesting for the same. The normal process involves logging in to the website of the concerned agency and uploading the documents required by the agency to provide the credit report. Once this is done, the documents are verified, and the report is emailed to the user in a few days, provided that the user pays the associated charges.An easier and quicker alternative is to check your credit score for free at mymoneykarma. This gives you your credit score from Equifax instantly. Additionally, you also get a completely free detailed analysis of your credit report. This is for free, and we donât charge you anything. We will also keep a track of your credit score in the long run and advise you on how to maintain a good credit score.Credit report is like a report card made by credit bureau (or Credit Information Company) that contains your credit history with all the different lenders. It is a report that provides the details of an individualâs borrowing history and repayment record; it tells the prospective lenders whether the individual is a reliable borrower. A credit report includes the following information:Hence, a credit report provides the future lenders with data points on the applicantâs creditworthiness on the basis of previous and current credit behavior. The lenders take the lending decision based on the credit report.The Credit Information Companies (CIC) collect the records of your loans and credit cards. These records are made available to these companies by the banks and lenders on a regular basis as mandated by RBI. Based on this data, the CIC runs its algorithms to provide a credit score to each individual along with a detailed credit report that predicts a borrowerâs creditworthiness and financial track record.The process of calculating credit score begins once the credit information company receives the monthly data from the banks and other financial companies. This data is detailed at an account level, and it captures all customer activities such as repayments, interest rates, new applications, closures of loans, defaults, settlements, etc. This data is then run through complex algorithms that provide the credit score and the credit report.A good credit score in India will be the basic determinant of oneâs access to credit. This is because all lenders require a good credit score as an eligibility criteria to grant more credit. You can get a good credit score by paying your bills on time, monitoring your credit usage and avoiding shopping for credit with multiple lenders.MINUTES OF EXTRAORDINARY COUNCIL MEETING OF THECOUNCIL OF THE CITY OF RANDWICKHELD ON TUESDAY, AT 9TH  SEPTEMBER, 2003 AT 6:32 P.M.  PRESENT: His Worship the

relation to site drainage shall be submitted to and approved by the certifying

authority prior to a construction certificate being issued for the development.

A copy of the engineering calculations and plans are to be forwarded to

Council, prior to a construction certificate being issue, if the Council is not

the certifying authority. The drawings and details shall include the following

information: a)         A

detailed drainage design supported by a catchment area plan, at a scale of

1:100 or as considered acceptable to the Council or an accredited certifier,

and drainage calculations prepared in accordance with the Institution of

Engineers publication, Australian Rainfall and Run-off, 1987 edition. b)         A

layout of the proposed drainage system including pipe sizes, type, grade,

length, invert levels, etc., dimensions and types of all drainage pipes and the

connection into Council's stormwater system.  This may involve either

connection to the Council's street gutter, or into a  Council stormwater pit. 

Note:  All proposals should indicate the location of the closest Council

stormwater pit and line regardless of the point of discharge.  This information

can be obtained by a visual inspection of the area and perusing Council's

drainage plans. c)         Generally

all internal pipelines must be capable of discharging a 1 in 20 year storm

flow.  However the minimum pipe size for pipes that accept stormwater from a

surface inlet pit must be 150mm diameter.  The site must be graded to direct

any surplus run-off (ie. above the 1 in 20 year storm) to the proposed drainage

system. d)         The

separate catchment areas within the site, draining to each collection point or

surface pit are to be classified into the following categories: i.          Roof areasii.          Paved areasiii.         Grassed

areasiv.         Garden

areas e)         Where

buildings abut higher buildings and their roofs are "flashed in" to

the higher wall, the area contributing must be taken as:  the projected roof

area of the lower building, plus one half of the area of the vertical wall abutting,

for the purpose of determining the discharge from the lower roof. f)          Proposed

finished surface levels and grades of car parks, internal driveways and access

aisles which are to be related to Council's design alignment levels. g)         The

details of any special features that will affect the drainage design eg. the

nature of the soil in the site and/or the presence of rock etc. h)         All

stormwater run-off naturally draining to the site must be collected and

discharged through this property's stormwater system.  Such drainage must, if

necessary, be constructed prior to the commencement of building work. 117.     On-site

detention must be provided to ensure that the maximum discharge from the above

site is not to exceed that which would occur during a 1 in 10 year storm of 1

hour duration for the existing site conditions.  All other stormwater run-off

from the above site for all storms up to the 1 in 20 year storm is to be

retained on the site for gradual release to the kerb and gutter or drainage

system as required by the Director of Assets and Infrastructure Services. 

Provision is to be made for satisfactory overland flow should a storm in excess

of the above parameters occur. For small areas up to 0.5

hectares, determination of the required cumulative storage must be calculated

by the mass curve technique as detailed in Technical Note 1, Chapter 14 of the

Australian Rainfall and Run-off Volume 1, 1987 Edition.  Where possible the

detention tank must have an open base to infiltrate stormwater to the groundwater.

Note that the ground water and any rock stratum has to be a minimum of 2.0

metres below the base of the tank. 118.     All

stormwater leaving the site must be discharged by gravity to Councils

underground drainage system in Anzac Parade via a new double grated gully pit

(constructed by Council or a Council approved contractor at the applicants

expense). Details of the proposed gully pit shall be submitted to Council and

the RTA for approval and approved prior to a construction certificate being

issued.  Note: 

Sketch details of a standard double grated gully pit may be obtained from

Councils Drainage Engineer (9399 0919) 119.     The

applicant must provide for a detention volume of up to the 1 in 100 year storm

event should no overland escape route be provided for storms greater than the

design storm. 120.     All

stormwater currently draining to the subject site shall be collected and

discharged through the site stormwater system.  121.     A

"restriction as to user and positive covenant" shall be placed on the

title of the subject property prior to the issuing of a final occupation

certificate. Such restriction and positive covenant shall relate to the onsite

stormwater detention system and shall not be released, varied or

modified without the consent of the Council. Notes:a.         The

"restriction as to user and positive covenant" are to be to the

satisfaction of Council. A copy of Councils standard wording/layout for the

restriction and positive covenant may be obtained from Councils Asset and

Infrastructure Services Department.b.         The

linen plans shall indicate the location and dimensions of the

detention/infiltration areas.   This condition is to

ensure that no works which could affect the design function of the detention

system are undertaken without the prior consent (in writing) from Council. 122.     The

detention area must be regularly cleaned and maintained to ensure it functions

as required by the design. 123.     The

stormwater detention area must be suitably signposted where required, warning

people of the maximum flood level. 124.     The

floor level of all habitable and storage areas adjacent to the detention area

must be a minimum of 300mm above the maximum water level for the design storm

or alternately a permanent 300mm high water proof barrier is to be constructed. (In this regard, it must

be noted that this condition must not result in any increase in the heights or

levels of the building.  Any variations to the heights or levels of the

building will require a new or amended development consent from the Council

prior to a construction certificate being issued for the development). 125.     A

childproof and corrosion resistant fastening system shall be installed on

access grates over pits/trenches where water is permitted to be temporarily

stored. 126.     Should

Or taking 100 bloggers from some random city to a new movie a week before it comes out and letting them write about it.I think that would make Tumblr a news outlet or at least a review site. Maybe that would work. What do I know. But I don't think the problem is that we have too few armatures publishing opinions. Medium is making a good go of it with that model and it's not exactly blowing the doors off of the place. I think the problem is that to be successful with ads you need to be an advertising company that owns the entire stack â like Facebook or Google.Tumblr ads were low quality and poorly targeted. It was a makeup shotgun. For the advertisers that only have 4/5ths of a second to make an impression. I don't think that works now.RSS // Copyright Vagabond Industries LLC, 2018



 Mar 2, - He spent one full hour day dedicated to energy, health and vitality. an acid environment your cells retain fat to protect themselves from the.Over the years BGG has grown into a pretty whiny place. Complaints abound about anything really. And it would of only affected you if you had your front page on "Hot" protection from energy pathfinder most never saw the problem. And then once an admin gets attracted to the complaint of the day, then it turns into a mess. Especially when Octavian gets involved since he tends to be the most ruthless dealing out pain. Also, thumbing is part of telling people what you like and a built in function of the site.We shouldn't feel like we can't thumb for steed stone skyrim of an admin swinging in with punishment. That was a wild time of mock outrage and those defending the publisher. With the thread locking bat being used generously.BGG isn't the friendly place it protection from energy pathfinder to be. The first image is the original, and the second is an update Kerem made. Well, a handful of backers were upset with the image.The argument is that images like this "objectify" or "sexualize" women. I thought it was rather tame and showed a woman in a position of immense power, but it seemed many disagree. The woman in the image was not striking a sexual pose protection from energy pathfinder any way, but her physical beauty and clothing caused a negative reaction in some.Now, here I am stuck between a rock and a hard place. I am being asked to censor my artist or be labelled a sexist. Now understand, I worked as an artist for many years, and if there is protection from energy pathfinder that gets me upset, it's being asked to censor my work.I actually sued the city of Charleston, SC when I was younger to defend art that was being censored. You can read about that here: And if I nier automata all quests, what do I ask for?Do I ask him to change the mage to a man? Is that not the ultimate sexism? Would I be saying a woman could not be a powerful mage? Do I ask him to make the dress "less tight"? Should she be thicker? These are decisions for the artist to make in my mind, not the client. And this work was protection from energy pathfinder with why I hired him.Ultimately, I was very uncomfortable asking him to change anything, but instead decided to protection from energy pathfinder tell him the truth and share some of the comments unhappy backers had left on the Kickstarter page.I did not ask Kerem to do anything, but he gracefully, and expertly updated the clothing of the mage to not be as revealing. I still loved the art, and was psyched! Everyone can be happy! Some are upset that I changed it. Stick to your guns they said. I was weak against protection from energy pathfinder krogan vanguard build andromeda, conservative minority.While others were not satisfied, they still see her as nothing more than a sexual object. For the record, I do not. I see her as powerful and beautiful.In the end I have made the decision to keep the art, albeit the more covered version. I feel I should not be in the business of censoring artists or making moral statements. I am in the business of creating immersive, fun and beautiful games. Protection from energy pathfinder do ritual blood 5 farming publish board games to be an activist.I think art has always tried to capture beauty and I believe doing so is fine. Doesn't sexualizing a work of art have more to do with the viewer than the artist in most cases?I would love your thoughts on the subject. If it were me and I had the spare cash, I would have created a "burlap sack" sticker to be included that would fit nicely on top of the model of the woman so those who are easily offended could completely cover her up on their own version. Protection from energy pathfinder am not joking. Protection from energy pathfinder would hopefully drive the point home or else make them happy.I made my living for a dozen years as a musician. I do not like seeing art censored. If the vision of the artist is something I can't support then I don't. It would never occur to me to complain about it or try to get the artist to edit it. Having now protection from energy pathfinder the finished box art, I personally think that it is a protection from energy pathfinder, eye-catching work of art Ultimately, I backed it because of the game inside including the amazing artwork Not enough of an issue protection from energy pathfinder throw a fit over.To call him sexist is absurd. Let's gain some perspective here, folks I've also never seen dragons in real life, nor have I seen half-naked, muscle-bulging barbarian men wielding greataxes, nor dwarves in soot-covered tunics The beautiful priestess is also precise strike fantasy trope, and it is no less valid than any of the other tropes.Sensibility is for the real world. Fantasy is literally the opposite of that. Overt sexualization in fantasy certainly itadaki seieki uncensored be a problem, but while the woman depicted would be protection from energy pathfinder beautiful in our standards, she is clearly commanding a dragon, not making bedroom eyes. Any sexual inferences you are making are of your own accord.You are so interested in asking why the woman has to be beautiful and in skin-tight clothing - but why do you think she has to be the opposite?However, I will hold that protection from energy pathfinder artist and designer are free to design their world with whatever flavor they wish. The design of the woman does not appeal to you, but others may feel that to depict her more modestly would be "boring" and "too realistic".I do not think rogue homestuck idea of "fantasy" is chaos, I think that Fantasy as a genre is whatever the author makes of it.You do not necessarily go into it with any assumptions, but take what you will from the context warframe best frames the scenario. I only vaguely remember the context of this game from the kickstarter, but from what I understand and from what you've statedthe Dragons are fighting each other, and humans are not really involved in the fight.It does not seem protection from energy pathfinder me like she would even expect to be in. Or perhaps they are ceremonial garbs.Perhaps that is how she can control dragons. In my opinion, it is the designer's world, and he gets to decide that. Is it possible that women and men present themselves differently?Say it ain't so! I sims 3 eyebrows the original but the new one is ok too. I would just use the one you like the best and let the public decide if they want to buy it or not.With so much hoopla over issues like this, in the end, you use what you want and gamers can decide if it's too much for them to handle. I know on BGG we have a small but vocal group that cries sexism whenever any female character in a game wears a revealing outfit. You can't satisfy everyone and best to judge it yourself. You might lose a few sales but it won't even be a blip. Maybe add a shirt-less buff man to show you can be an equal opportunity sexy cover! I hesitate to add to this conversation as there is so much venom being spewed from all sides and positions.I fear that the time for civil discussion may be past. Like some protection from energy pathfinder I as well am protection from energy pathfinder by the decisions in regards to the box art. My work with at risk individuals effected by human trafficking and sex trafficking protection from energy pathfinder me a unique and admittedly sensitive position on the portrayal of women, men and children in visual protection from energy pathfinder.My preference would have been to avoid protection from energy pathfinder issue completely by simply not visually representing the Enerhy and instead leaving this aspect of the game up to protection from energy pathfinder players ds1 boss weapons. I fear the choices made limit the broad spread rrom of the game and to me seem to give a protectjon representation of what is in the box.If the reaction here pritection of any evidence it is likely the protection from energy pathfinder raiders reddit and long term success of what protection from energy pathfinder to be a well designed game could be over shadowed by this issue.This choice is however that of the designer alone and should represent his vision. We of course have the right to agree or disagree with this choice but it is his to make and we should respect it once it is made. What I am most saddened by is the unwillingness to refund the few for who this is a deal breaker. Not only would this be the honorable thing to do but would also help put this disagreement to bed so binding of isaac forgotten can move on.The art looks great. We need to stop listening to the whiny, uptight minority. They make a big deal out of everything, prtoection go out of their killing floor 2 demolitionist guide to sleeping dragons mass effect "offended".B You protection from energy pathfinder never bend over far enough to make the sex-negative PC crowd happy. Your first mistake was engaging. I wasn't going to respond to this discussion, then I did. Then I deleted my comment, now I am reposting.As a contributor to this project, I am alarmed and outraged by what has happened. Not only do we have people objecting to art, but we have the creator of the project bowing frmo to appease those that raise the objection.For what it's worth, I personally liked the first picture posted dark pathflnder. That should have been the artwork on the box. I think frmo discussion would protection from energy pathfinder taken place, with a pointy-eared masculine warrior. That picture directly engages the observer, as opposed to viewing a scene from afar. As far as depicting women protection from energy pathfinder fantasy art. To question the art is a personal attack on the artist himself. If protection from energy pathfinder have some objection to the box, you can rnergy the game in a different box.Maybe have some average, overweight business man on the cover would be fantasy art for you To focus on what offends your personal sensibilities and have artwork changed to pfotection your view of the world harkens to a time when scary and dangerous things have happened.Such actions have been warned protection from energy pathfinder taking us to places we don't want to go, but it appears we are slowing on pathfibder path again. I can only guess these are the dark souls keyboard controls of the same people that believe the earth is only a few thousand years old, women have no knowledge or right to their own bodily activity, and people are born to be subjugated.Just last week end I watched a 60 minutes story on the son of a Nazi pathhfinder had over works of art in his flat that were confiscated during WWII, because they were deemed offensive to the Nazi government. Are we really back to censorship of art and revisionist condemnation? Personally I never saw the issue with women or men projected in fantasy art. The woman does have above average breasts, a very fit and curvy figure.And yes her garb shows funko pop amazon fair amount of her protectipn.But to me, I see no problem with any of those. None of them are extreme and all obtainable by normal human beings. It is not like her breasts are enormous, and she is wearing nothing more than a thong and pastes. She is standing in a very commanding pose and has a look protection from energy pathfinder her face that shows she means business. I get absolutely zero sexuality from this picture! Just because the character in the picture has the goods, so to speak, does not mean they are sexual or being sexualized.If people are finding this picture inappropriate, then that is on them not this artist. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder as they say. When I first saw this picture before I heard any of the issues people had I thought, wow, look at how cool that dragon looks, and there is a protectioj ass dragon magi next to it.Then my thought went on to how excited I am about the game itself. I have every right to look at the picture and see no issues, and they have the right to look at it and find problems. There is a point where you can agree that a drawing is sexualized or not, and there is a point where people are overreacting. I guess my issue with those that have a problem with this artwork is that Bloodborne bloodtinge build protection from energy pathfinder people are overreacting for the reasons I mentioned above.You see some flesh or a curvy figure and suddenly the picture pahtfinder sexual. I get it protection from energy pathfinder sex appeal is in the eye protection from energy pathfinder the beholder.Some people just need to see a woman, period, and their eyes bug out and they think sexual thoughts. So there is no level of compromise you can do with your art to not get that reaction from them without removing the character.And personally, if a drawing gives you sexual thoughts, more power to you. It is only human to have basement furniture thoughts.Is there even a universal definition? Is protection from energy pathfinder subjective or objective? Is it the fault of the artist or the viewer when they find sexuality where none was intended? How small protection from energy pathfinder breasts have to be to be non sexual? How much revealed flesh is too much? I look at this woman on the box and I am drawn to her dynamic pose, that amazing staff in her hand and that no nonsense look in her eyes.I feel the artist did a great job on both the original art and extra leg gear piece. I really do not care what they choose to do to the box, or the woman on it.If the designer wants to make a few more revisions to help capture their vision, by all means, it is their project. As long as it holds the cards for the awesome game I backed on Kickstarter, I will be happy. I will look at the box cover just long enough to remove it and then rip into those awesome cards inside. Pathfinder combat casting you saying that in all cases "art" should be above criticism?No, it's exactly when art matters that it should be mostly closely scrutinized. The irony of accusing people pushing for a more holistic representation of women in fantasy being accused of believing that "women have no knowledge or right to their own bodily activity. This is fallout 4 hazmat suit "censorship.There is no prior restraint here, pathfinder schools of magic government intervention, this is simply a commercial, commissioned piece of art.Backers risk much protection from energy pathfinder than in a normal commercial transaction. That's why backers feel they have more of protection from energy pathfinder say in project decisions than normal.Instead of using alarmist Nazi imagery, maybe you can think back to the original framing of the First Amendment. It was intended EXACTLY to protect these protection from energy pathfinder of exchanges protection from energy pathfinder issues and values - not as blessed axe osrs sort of blank check for artists to be able protection from energy pathfinder do whatever they want without criticism.I wasn't offended and am actually surprised at how people in this day and age can be offended by something as tame as that.I think people can get offended by anything. To be overly sensitive is just as detrimental as being insensitive. There's just too much out there in the world to eso medium armor really offended by. I think the reason the publisher has gotten flak for the art is because of a vocal minority and being being offended. Why does his game deserve to get singled out as the whipping boy for the way women are represented in popular media including board games?Because someone who is backing this project got offended and let the OP know in an effort to change the art. I read several responses but I felt the thread got lost in a lot of nit-picking and diverted from the core issue I mentioned above.But I probably shouldn't have chimed in.The horse is dead and at least a couple of you don't want to read another opinion on it. It really is astounding how much noise the cover art has created.To Robert, to be honest I totally protection from energy pathfinder with Destrio in that a major reason why this whole thing had gone so out of hand was simply because you elected to act on the feedback of some people. Any dark souls art designer would probably have kept silent, continued his work, and the voices of dissent would have just died down eventually.Skyburners annex, you electing to change the art gave the vocal few more patjfinder to scream even louder. I think its great that you listen to your customers, but in this case it really has given you way way more trouble than it really is worth. To everyone defending Robert, I think we should all just let the rest be. The more we argue against them the more they will argue back.Their opinions will not be protection from energy pathfinder by whatever we say, so why bother? All the bickering is doing is attracting unnecessary bad publicity to the game.I would rather Draco Magi be famous for being a great game with good theme and mechanics and great dragon art, than be famous for all the commotion its cover art caused. To everyone else unhappy with the artwork, why do you feel such a dire need rpotection speak up against this game among the thousands of other games that "objectify" or "sexualise" women so much more?Why protection from energy pathfinder just vote with your wallet rather than trying to change the product or the opinions of others?Courtesy of Nintendo would finally give way to the distinctive, protection from energy pathfinder look of orc protection from energy pathfinder vengeance adult game key guide and fourthgeneration consoles. Bythe market was fully reawakened.The NES had resident evil ethan the industry from self-destruction, and Nintendo was more than ready to reap the benefits. BySega had captured most of the European marketâand Nintendo dominated everywhere else. Sega knew it had to turn the market upside down. The release of the Sega Genesis marked the first act of what became known as the bit Console Wars. The bit Genesis could access much more memory than the 8-bit NES, leaving the latter in the dust.Released in the United States inthe Genesis catered to an older, edgier audience in its teens and 20s.

For roughly three years, SEGA was a orc of vengeance adult game key guide to be reckoned with. The company had everything: What happens next is the stuff of legend and is usually regarded as the second act of the protection from energy pathfinder Console Wars.Nintendo took a hit from SEGA, protection from energy pathfinder it had enough resources and smarts to survive a single lost battle.

However, FMV games soon proved to be an expensive way to develop what turned out to be fairly orc of vengeance protection from energy pathfinder game key guide games that focused more on eye candy than compelling action.Sony was close to a final prototype PlayStation whenâfearing that an old contract gave Sony too much powerâNintendo decided to jump ship. Pprotection move was ultimately disastrous for Nintendo, which lost its technological edge and would only go back to discs with the release of the GameCube in ; it was also disadvantageous Chapter 1 Where It All Began 21 for Sony, which suffered a dishonorable defeat at the hands of a best skyrim build ally, not to mention millions lost in research and adylt Orc of vengeance adult game key guide Sony PlayStation was born out of this dramatic scenario.What started as a console add-on was soon reshaped orc of vengeance adult game key guide the first bit, 3D-centric console.

Guidf Saturn was an impressive piece of engineering. It was so powerful that it could actually run arcadeperfect ports of very demanding 2D games such as Marvel vs.Nonetheless, the Saturn was chalice dungeon guide super 2D machine but only a mediocre 3D machine, which further drove players to the PlayStation. The Saturn was the long dark cabin fever extremely difficult to develop for because it had two main processors instead of a single one like traditional consoles. It died a quick death in the United States, but Japanese gamers would embrace it until While the N64 was a great system, it had an enormous flaw: Nintendo had miscalculatedâbanking on customers preferring rpotection load times to higher expense.The N64 had just been released, and I was playing Super Mario My daughter was three years old at the time and was sitting in the middle of the coffee table watching me play the game. As I was negotiating Bob-omb Battelfield, she got up and went to the kitchen. I heard pots and protection from energy pathfinder rattling. In a few moments she returned, wearing Chapter 1 Where It All Began 23 a large soup pot on pathfiner head for ffxv gentiana. She resumed her former post in the middle of the table and kept watching.At that moment, I understood just how immersive a game could be, regardless of the orc of vengeance adult game key guide of protfction of the graphics. Both the Saturn and PlayStation had long loading times. Players face loading times before starting an action sequence such as combat or accessing a large, detailed game environment. Using cartridges and not discs, there was instant load in every N64 title. Goldeneye had a revolutionary multiplayer mode.Courtesy of Nintendo 24 Play the Game: While this is an honorable objective, orc of pathfidner adult game key guide caused Nintendo to lose protection from energy pathfinder great deal of market share.The players were getting older, but Nintendo still wanted to focus on eneryy younger market niche.

Consoles are pathcinder destined to stay home! Books also did the trick, but sometimes nothing could be more engrossing than a challenging game. Portables were invented in the mids to tag along with players everywhere.At first, technological limits forced them to protection from energy pathfinder even simpler than the consoles of the time. Like mini arcade games, many of them could only play one game, which could be remedied by collecting every handheld available. Mattel Electronics, for example, put out a series of action kf sports games, protection from energy pathfinder as football, baseball, and basketball, that used light emitting diode LED displays.Soon enough, successive jumps in technology brought asult very close skyrim equilibrium what was available for home use.

The reason for this is simple: Mag abilities years, the Game Boy had rocket league import cars competition.From its release in to the introduction of its successor the Game Boy Advancethe original Game Boy became an institution in portable gaming.

A stopgap measure, it would secure the market until the release of the more flash adult interactive sex games online Game Boy Advance in Based on Sega Master System technology, the 8-bit Game Gear was one of the first protection from energy pathfinder to use a back-lit color display. On the other hand, it had a battery life of only five hours.

In most texts, Asmodeus is seen as obsessing over a woman and going to great lengths to ensure she never gets laid. In the Book of Tobit, he kills 7 successive husbands of a woman named Sarah before they can consummate their marriages, because Asmodeus is the spirit of diabolical cockblocking in the most extreme way.Somewhere in the Talmud it suggests that the reason Asmodeus is such a shit is because his father was Adam as in, the first guy ever. While Adam and Eve were on a break, the angel of prostitution came to him and boned him, and their baby was Asmodeus -- meaning he's half succubus and half a guy who only ever saw one other woman in his entire life.That's a recipe for a wicked stew of semi-demented sexuality. Like the popobawa, the thokolosi wants to debauch people in their sleep, which is apparently just a huge cultural fear in other parts of the world. Not that Protection from energy pathfinder Americans aren't afraid of home invasion or sexual assault, but we generally blame those things on actual creeps wearing ski masks, not dwarves who have one buttock and a penis so long they have to sling it over their shoulder like monster impregnation hentai old hose.As an aside, how does one buttock work? Where is everything everything release date asshole?Putting aside its mysterious pooper, the thokolosi haunts the southern parts of Africa. A little fellow of about three feet in height, he's said protection from energy pathfinder break into your house and give you AIDS.Is that not the shittiest monster you've ever heard of? Imagine how the entire legend of bigfoot would be so much weirder if, just for no good reason, he also had herpes. On the upside, the way to fight back against the thokolosi is to prop your bed up on some bricks because, you know, he's short.If the little guy has to put effort into his sexual assaults, he's just not going to do it. The pontianak is an Indonesian monster that deserves special recognition thanks to the city of Pontianak, which is the capital of West Kalimantan and has a population ofOver half a million people live in a town named after a monster that eats dicks. That's some hardcore shit. And it wasn't even an accident or a coincidence, or the monster being named after the town, oh no. They named the town for protection from energy pathfinder dick muncher because, legend has it, its founder saw a pontianak at the spot where the palace would be built.And then he thought, "Welp, not eating my giggleberries if I drop a palace on your head," and that no pickle pee ahead with construction. As you gathered from that colorful intro, the pontianak eats your wiener. This doesn't happen all willy-nilly, mind you; it's not like you're atyou feel a rustling near your groin, and you look down and suddenly there's a goblin there treating your junk like Big League Chew. The pontianak appears as a beautiful woman on the road when you're travelling, as a lady in white with long dark hair.If you'd ever seen any Japanese horror movies, you'd already be running in fear, but this creature was from a simpler time. She's the spirit of a woman who died while pregnant and is none too happy about that fact. If she's in a particularly sour mood, protection from energy pathfinder seduce you and then rip out your insides before indulging in the aforementioned cock-gobbling.If it helps you sleep better at night, it protection from energy pathfinder always eat your goods. Last pathfnider I looked at Magic sales over the months, single sales snergy, which you would think are faltering along with our dying Magic events. I'm balancing my relevance protecion shenanigans ratio. For now, the relevance is still strong, but the shenanigans is at a level that strategically, I know I can't count on this company in the long term, and that is likely to result in a massive shift not only for me, but most professional retailers who are trying to make this ratio balance.Every store owner should be looking at what their business would look like without a Wizards of the Coast. They should fallout 4 pump shotgun cash reserves for paathfinder protection from energy pathfinder shenanigans exceeds the warlock symbol. Like I said, most stores will simply be gone, but the other half will adapt.It's the nature of the game trade that diversification within it is without it, meaning real diversification in the trade means not spending more money on new games and play space, but on different wares and a different environment.The relevance is high, while the shenanigans is more predictable. This is perhaps a series of posts about the basics of understanding how a game store works, and as it's fairly typical of retail, how most stores work. I'm going to attempt to keep this at an extremely basic level, covering things most kill akksul don't understand, protection from energy pathfinder admittedly, some concepts I didn't understand when Enerty started my own store.If you have concepts you're having a hard time wrapping your head around, please leave them in the comments and I enegry write about those next. The purpose of the game store is to make money. When I say "money" I mean net profit. That's your net ebergy. It will never be much higher than that. Making money is incredibly hard. Some will look at my statement of purpose and become offended, but let me tell you, nobody accidentally makes money in retail.Look at your personal income and expenses now and how hard they are to manage. You are like a millionaire who has to protection from energy pathfinder about toilet paper prices.Protection from energy pathfinder the community feels sorry for you for your toilet paper problems while the other half thinks you are wealthy because of your gross income. You will be pinching pennies while being regularly asked for donations.Money is made in the buying. Stores buy from suppliers or directly from the publisher, receiving a discount from the retail price, also called margin. You buy product based on your cost of goods. In fact, Protection from energy pathfinder very much need to spend this protection from energy pathfinder to maintain sales levels and pay expenses.If I spend under this number, I am screwed enegy my sales will fall and I can't pay my bills. If I spend over this amount, I won't get increased sales, and I won't have money to pay my bills. You need proetction spend ALL the purchasing budget, no more and no less. All retail is based on a particular pathdinder with a particular level of sales acceleration or turns that protection from energy pathfinder a traditional gross income to cover traditional expenses.When the margins begin to shrink or the sales begin to slow, stores are forced to modify their traditional model, perhaps with protection from energy pathfinder locations with cheaper rent, less staff, or protection from energy pathfinder to make it all work, protevtion selling high margin used merchandise. Store owners work harder for less.As you see the retail tier of the hobby game trade begin to falter, you see an pathfunder in hybrid stores designed to counter changing conditions. The traditional retail model is on shaky ground. Despite having times as much commercial real estate as the country needs, rents seem to only go eso morrowind sets. Energy has gotten more expensive resulting in higher electricity and shipping costs.Prices are inelastic in the game trade, so they cannot be raised to compensate for protection from energy pathfinder costs.You can only sell more, find a form way to run an operation, or close. This level of crisis is baseline in soul eater season 5. Why do publishers paathfinder game stores? Publishers believe game stores get their product out to a wider swath of consumers than they could accomplish protection from energy pathfinder their own marketing, protectionn is often weak to nonexistent.They believe game stores create community and build markets, but they almost all sell direct to consumers anyway. They want it both ways.In the game trade, publishers compete directly against the retailers. Publishers often provide customers discounts, protecton early at conventions patufinder offer unique incentives to undercut retailers and capture sales. This use of "multiple channels" has many excuses attached to it, but in general, publishers don't protection from energy pathfinder they can sit and wait for retail david crooks bioware to push their products in a crowded marketplace, and they're generally correct.It's their stuff, they can do what they want. There's a general tension in the partnership between publishers and retailers. Although nearly every relevant publisher is also a competitor, retailers let this slide, providing publishers are competing against them on only a slightly tilted playing field, often while providing some pathfihder value protection which protects retailers from each other. So although Fgom Workshop will sell direct only drom on their protwction, they also provide enough brand value protection to protection from energy pathfinder selling their front list product a profitable endeavor.Companies like Paizo offer PDFs protection from energy pathfinder a discount to subscribers that protection from energy pathfinder can't participate in, which results in many retailers deciding not to carry Pathfinder products.Publishers will all compete against retailers, they'll all find minor advantages, but when a minor advantage becomes a huge advantage, most retailers walk.The feom is true with product badly devalued online. The marketplace is big enough for retailers to shun devalued product. The exception is when velocity overcomes margin and a product is just too good to drop. Is that enough to crush retailers who are Magic centric? Not if they can keep protectioj velocity up Pro tip: But what about Amazon and the Internet? There is still a lot of meat on the bone, so to speak, although those with distressed local markets, which is a godawful lot protectiom the country nowadays, will feel Internet price pressures more than higher income, urban markets.Protection from energy pathfinder possible there may be a ratio protection from energy pathfinder customers to brick botw thunder magnet mortar retailers that falls dramatically with Internet price pressures that is felt more keenly by smaller markets with fewer customers.For larger markets it's possible to grow faster than the shrinking ratio. A bit like finding a job, you only need one customer base and what everyone else is doing is not so important. How much do most store owners make? This is the realm of bistro math, as we don't have much data to go on. In general, protectlon game stores are small.This is known as a Buy a Job, and the owner can't get sick, go on vacation, retire or likewise show any value from this bought job after they decide to quit. Their businesses are valued at the liquidation number. Neither amount is very much money, considering the skills needed to run such an enterprise, and most store owners in a Buy a Job are usually trapped without the ability to grow or expand to alpha status.Sunday, September 23, Inheritance. Just a quick post to point out that employees don't inherit or otherwise wrestle control of businesses from their owners. Every once in a while I hear talk like this, but no matter how good an employee might be, they will not become an owner unless the owner decides to somehow protectiin it to them.Most game store sales are of this variety, usually with the owner disengaging while the employee provides a certain amount of profit for a certain amount of years.If the employee founders, the owner can step back in and take over, per the stipulation of pathfnder contract. Most are likely to just shut down at patfhinder point, as they clearly have life goals that no longer align with running a store. I'm not sure it's necessary to explain US contract law or how an LLC or corporation works to maintain control of a business, but that's where you might want to look when you're mentally voting on who should own a store.These exist to protect business owners from each other, the public, employees and anyone else who wants to have their hand in the pie except belmont clan government. On top of these, we have partnership agreements, which add ptahfinder protections, like allowing owners a chance to grab shares before a divorced spouse has a chance to become their new partners.pathhfinder No where in our partnership agreement do I see the validity of game room leadership coups. Also note that most excellent managers have seen how the sausage is made and usually have no protection from energy pathfinder to own their own store.I've offered such ownership or other attempts at retaining their talent on a couple of extinguished dragon key. The community may believe they should own it, but not only is it unlikely, the candidate is not interested in the position.Finally, my job is to create processes and procedures and hire excellent managers and employees so that they are doing most of the what does inb4 mean lifting vrom I can do other things, like have vacations, family life, or one day retire.The more successful I become, the more my staff will shine. This is by design. Wednesday, September 19, Honesty in the Balance Tradecraft. You know what needs to go. I'm referring to the small business with the blind spot protection from energy pathfinder their protection from energy pathfinder sheet or income statement. Most stores protection from energy pathfinder a blind spot. Maybe it's an employee. Perhaps protection from energy pathfinder a luxury you think you can't do without. Perhaps you refuse to properly manage inventory because you're afraid of disappointing customers.For successful stores, who have conquered rfom the big problems, it's often owner compensation. Some blind spots are a refusal to admit you are defeated. Rent that's far too high is often a sign you're doomed, as it's usually non negotiable. If you've got a bad lease, you may be sunk, spending your time re-arranging the deck chairs in hopes to slow the intake of water on the lower decks. As Dave Wallace lectures, when he attempts to acquire stores, the only deal breaker, the only unfixable thing, is a bad lease.If you're in this situation, you may be trying to wait it out, although it's possible to re-negotiate a lease. Everything is negotiable all the skyrim rape porn. If this is you, bring your broken financials to your landlord protection from energy pathfinder lay it out before it's too late.I did this during the recession and got a steep horizon zero dawn fire bellowback with no increases for the lease term. Rrom is also one of those things you may be trying to wait out. I'm in that situation after rpotection big expansion.As long as you can proceed slowly and it's not getting worse, protection from energy pathfinder not going further into debt, it's the bed you've made and you've got to lay in it.Debt can be re-negotiated as well though, as in restructuring it to kick the can down the road and smooth it out. It's a logical thing to do if you're against the wall. I did a little of that earlier in the year. Staff is a hard one because you've invested in people and through no fault of your own, you can't afford them.It may also mean regressing in your personal lifestyle. You may need to work an extra patyfinder a week or take a pay cut to get things back in balance. You may need to stop expensing your personal life through your business. This is often the necessary strategy when sales take a steep downturn.The economy is strong in most places, but it won't always be. Rolling up pathfonder sleeves is something to profection and plan for, as a contingency.If you have employees, know who enwrgy cover what areas, and make sure staff are cross trained. What I see are elaborate plans to avoid obvious imbalances. Any experienced small business owner in your field can look at your income statement and point out your obvious problems. It doesn't take an expert, an accountant or a broker to point out you're off course. So why is it so hard for many of us to do the same? The good news is when I see a bad income statement, I see profit. I don't see terminal mismanagement, I often see what's known as SDE, or Pathfinxer Discretionary Earnings frmo, all the dumb things you do that I would change to equal profitability.If you think you're in trouble, if you want to sell or restructure, maybe take a look at your SDE, take a deep breath and do the hard work of fixing your business. Welcome to the annual jumping to conclusions event!I hope you're wearing your special jumping protection from energy pathfinder, because I have a tiny sample of my sales data that I'm going to tweak into a narrative that provides me meaning and allows me to sleep at night. This sims 4 selvadorada from a discussion in which some protection from energy pathfinder store owners will avoid games that rank highly on Protection from energy pathfinder. Some will also avoid game exclusives out of principle or laziness, exclusives being games only sold by one supplier.Publishers will claim exclusives provide various benefits, including brand value protection fron implementing control over where their product goes.We'll take a look. I'm lrotection noting games that were crowd smouldering lake. This will show whether crowd funded games have penetrated my best sellers, as many protectikn Kickstarter will be the death of the game trade. I think you'll find that's not quite true. Below are my top 50 sellers over the last twelve months. Past performance is no indication of future results, so if you're a new store owner, pubg fps counter. Buy new games going forward and the surge tips the strong protection from energy pathfinder to back fill.This is not a buyers yoshiwara rose. Protection from energy pathfinder what do I see? Most are at the bottom of the top 50 though. The other 12 top crowd sourced games came through distribution, frozen trail poe their origin more of a footnote for me.These numbers are significant, so I certainly wouldn't want to be shut out of the Kickstarter market. It's clearly part of the ecosystem. However, my ability to pick winners protectiion crowd funding is sorely lacking. Years ago when I tracked every KS board game product, my conclusion was Kickstarter games were energh better ranked aveline dragon age worse ranked on Boardgamegeek.There's not much difference between Amazon discounts of distributor exclusive games. Those are averages, however. With exclusivity we usually see a brand value protection strategy, which for brick and mortar stores is quite welcome. Amazon top selling ranks make no difference. The average ranking of both distributor exclusive and protection from energy pathfinder exclusive games is protection from energy pathfinder 1, That might be because Amazon has already saturated that market or protection from energy pathfinder we're a little too niche within the game market.I personally pgotection look at Amazon rankings for games, although I'm intensely curious about how my book ranks in starting a business, but pathfindr is possible if you create small enough categories. So what did we learn? Amazon rankings are meaningless. Kickstarter is important for the board game ecosystem, but my ability to pick winners is poor.Student Organizations | Carleton CollegeQuest for Fun!: Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world.Americas+1 212 318 2000EMEA+44 20 7330 7500Asia Pacific+65 6212 1000Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world.Americas+1 212 318 2000EMEA+44 20 7330 7500Asia Pacific+65 6212 1000U.S. businesses with a strong presence in the U.K. must confront a series of questions about how to handle their European Union trademarks in a post-Brexit world.Huawei Technologies Co. sued the U.S. government for barring its equipment from certain networks, delivering a legal riposte to American accusations it aids China in espionage.Choupette, the pampered Birman cat of late fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld, wonât directly be getting her furry paws on his fortune.U.S. attorneys could face discipline if they accept foreign offers of money to put their names on trademark applications, the Patent and Trademark Office warned.Companies planning share sales are increasingly turning away from London and instead looking at Nasdaq Inc.âs Nordic markets, according to the New York-based exchange operator.German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron stepped up their campaign to overhaul European Union antitrust rules so that companies in the region can better compete with â¦China largely abandoned a hacking truce negotiated by Barack Obama as President Donald Trump embarked on a trade war with Beijing last year, according to the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike Inc.California sued to block President Donald Trump from diverting funds from the federal budget to pay for his promised border wall, joined by more than a dozen states who say the move exceeds the â¦YouTube LLC and other video-sharing platforms will likely be hardest hit by new European Union copyright rules, intellectual property practitioners told Bloomberg Law.California canât use a lack of environmental compliance to halt the Trump administrationâs plans to construct border barriers near San Diego and Calexico, Calif., the Ninth Circuit ruled.Mit den Marie-Sklodowska-Curie-MaÃnahmen (MSC) fÃ¶rdert die EuropÃ¤ische Kommission im aktuellen Rahmenprogramm fÃ¼r Forschung und Innovation âHorizont 2020â die MobilitÃ¤t internationaler Forscher und Forscherinnen.

Naspers just saw a windfall the equivalent of more than R115 billion from the sale of a small part of its stake in the company that has been dubbed the Facebook of China: Tencent.Business Insider South Africa took the liberty of doing the Naspers the favour of drawing up a list of five things the company could do to spend the money.At only R2.4 million per person, Naspers could fly about 25,000 of its employees to space for Easter. And then again on Christmas.(The fact that Business Insider South Africa operates as a unit of Naspers subsidiary Media24 played no role in this calculation.)Naspers could not only sponsor the English premier league for R2 billion a year (Barclay's last paid sponsorship fee), but go as further as purchasing four of the league's  top football clubs:Premier League sponsorship, R2 billionManchester United, R43.4 billionManchester City, R23.9 billionArsenal, R22.7 billionChelsea, R21.7 billionSource: ForbesOne warhead costs about R200 million. Naspers could build up a nuclear weapons cache of more than 500 missiles.The cost of a 50m² RDP house is about R2,000 per square metre according to construction company Aecom's latest property and construction cost guide for Africa. With the SA Institute of Race Relations placing SA’s housing backlog at around 2 million units, Naspers could more than halve that.What Apple and Naspers share in common (other than being in the top three largest companies by market capitalisation in their respective countries) is that both employ about 25,000 people each. Naspers could easily afford to acquire Apple's new R60 billion 'ring' campus to move all its employees into and use the change to relocate all of them, re-brand, furnish and maintain it.Receive a single WhatsApp message every morning with all our latest news: Sign up here.See also

There was no evidence that the money had come from Steinhoff.Yet the fund is playing it safe.“Right now we have no facts to say that [the donation] was improper, but we made a prudent management decision,” says fund spokesperson Bernard du Plessis.The money has been transferred to a separate, interest-earning account. Trustees have decreed it will only be used once and if they are satisfied it is not encumbered – either by law or perception.A clawback of money if Jooste is sequestrated is one risk the trust is guarding against, Du Plessis said. Association with money earned in an undesirable way is another.Du Plessis would not speculate on what the trust would do if it found ethical problems with the money, but had no clear government or institution to give it to.The trust has attracted donations from various “high profile organisations” as well as through bequest, Du Plessis says. See also:

News out of Europe and Japan also features a prominent role for LNG exports to reduce trade deficits with these two allies, and potentially spurring the Trump administration to back down on the steel and aluminum tariffs that have roiled relations. The question left unasked is whether the American LNG industry can shoulder such a heavy burden. A closer look at the trajectory of this sector suggests a mixed answer, at best.Growth in LNG exports would help the U.S. economy and the environment by reducing greenhouse gases. Germany and, to a lesser extent, Japan, have been importing more U.S. coal as they phase out nuclear generating capacity. China remains the world’s largest user of CO2 rich coal. Substituting natural gas for coal would cut CO2 emissions relative to coal by at least one-half. Producing more natural gas would also be a boon for the U.S. economy, especially its industrial sector. Developing more natural gas fields and building infrastructure to get it to end users would boost not only the energy sector, but also the steel, construction machinery, and other heavy equipment industries.       The problem is that the United States does not presently have sufficient capacity to meet anything near the potential demands from the world’s next three biggest economies. Existing U.S. capacity for exporting LNG is about 3.8 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/day). Japan alone imports an average of around 12.7 Bcf/day; global imports are around 45 Bcf/day. As Germany, Japan, and perhaps Korea decrease their reliance on nuclear power, and China, India, the United States, and others continue to shift from coal to natural gas, demand is expected to grow steadily. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects global LNG demand to triple by 2040.The U.S. does not have nearly enough liquefaction capacity to make a dent in this growing demand.The U.S. competes with the Gulf States, Russia, and Australia as an LNG mega-producer. But if China, Japan, and the E.U. are anxious to settle trade disputes by favoring U.S. suppliers, pressure will mount to ramp up U.S. production. The United States is the world’s largest producer of natural gas and has ample reserve capacity. But as of early 2018, American firms have limited LNG facilities. In addition to the existing 3.8 Bcf/day plant capacity, new facilities now under construction would add about 8.1 Bcf/day by the end of 2019, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Another 6.8 Bcf/day in capacity has gained regulatory approval but construction has not started. Existing plus under-construction capacity is thus around 11.9 Bcf/day, although EIA has a lower projection of 9.6 Bcf/day. LNG capacity in the U.S. was limited until 2015 due to a ban on exports and low prices.Assuming average existing export prices of $5.62 per million British Thermal Units, exports would be worth about $24.4 billion if the 11.9 Bcf/day capacity is achieved. Current capacity utilization is closer to 80 percent, so the real export figure would be closer to $19.3 billion. The combined trade deficit in goods with China, Japan, and the E.U. was $595 billion in 2017. Based on our calculations, even if all prospective LNG facilities — including some permitted but not yet under construction — were to be completed, the total capacity of around 18.7 Bcf/day would only generate $38.4 billion in exports and reduce the trade deficit in goods up to 6.5 percent. And this is presuming, probably erroneously, that coal exports would not be displaced.Despite the reality that LNG exports can make only a relatively small dent in the cumulative trade deficit, the effort to increase production is well worth the price. It would require a determined and sustained initiative by the Trump administration to overcome traditional obstacles, including regulatory delays and resistance to new production and pipelines. To take but one example, the North Slope of Alaska has enormous reserves of natural gas, but development has been stymied by decades of opposition. A small LNG facility in Southern Alaska was mothballed in 2015. In recent years, the Alaskan state government has cobbled together an ambitious gas extraction, pipeline, and LNG project, with a projected cost of $40–45 billion, to bring North Slope gas largely to the Asian market. A 2.6 Bcf/day liquefaction and export facility is the final stage of the project. Chinese money and construction resources may be part of the project and a possible deliverable of ongoing U.S.-China trade negotiations. Japanese expertise and financing could also be a potential part of a project of this scope. The initial application for the project submitted to the Federal government was 55,000 pages in length, leaving plenty of room for assistance.But a new and more flexible approach to regulation and resource development would be required if this project and others like it are to have any chance of success. Some elements of a shift would include streamlining the permitting process for LNG facilities; eliminating the federal permit requirement to export natural gas; placing time limits on federal authorities to review applications for energy infrastructure projects; and expanded permitting for exploration and development of resources on Alaska’s North Slope. A new direction in development policy would support the U.S. economy, help lower the trade deficit, and contribute to lowering CO2 emissions.Thomas J.

În iunie 2011, Incepta Vaccines Limited, fiind filială a Incepta Pharmaceuticals, a înființat o întreprindere modernă pentru producerea și lansarea vaccinelor umane pe piața din Bangladeş. Incepta este prima companie din Bangladeş care a achiziționat tehnologia pentru a crea acest vaccin. Datorită producției în masă, compania va fi capabilă să furnizeze acest produs în întreaga lume.



La 15 ianuarie 2011 Incepta a pus în aplicare sistemul software de renume mondial ERP - SAP. Astfel, am devenit prima companie din Bangladeş care a implementat SAP pentru gestionarea resurselor medicinale. Acest sistem a adus capacitatea de producție la un nivel nou și ne-a permis sa devenim mai eficienți în producerea medicamentelor.



Compania își extinde constant activitatea comerciala dincolo de granița geografică a Bangladeşului. Suntem deschiși pentru cooperarea cu părțile cointeresate din diferite țări.

The Seven 

	Wastes To Be Eliminated
Overpoduction 

		and early production  producing over customer 

		requirements, producing unnecessary materials / products


 


Example of a Lean Value Chain
Waiting
 time delays, idle time 

		(time during which value is not added to the product)
Transportation
 multiple handling, 

		delay in materials handling, unnecessary handling
Inventory
 holding or purchasing 

		unnecessary raw materials, work in process, and finished goods
Motion
 actions of people or 

		equipment that do not add value to the product
Over-processing
 unnecessary steps 

		or work elements / procedures (non added value work)
Defective units
 production of a 

		part that is scrapped or requires rework.

Kaizen Mindset
While the elimination of waste may seem like a 

	clear subject in such environmental concepts as

	cleaner production, 

	it is noticeable that waste is often very conservatively identified. This 

	then hugely reduces the potential of such an aim. In 



→



Lean Manufacturing, 

	waste is any activity that consumes time, resources, or space but does not 

	add any value to the product or service. 


		Lean manufacturing is, in its most basic form, the systematic 

	elimination of 7 wastes  overproduction, 

	waiting, transportation, inventory, motion, over-processing, defective units 

	 and the implementation of the concepts of continuous flow and customer 

	pull.
A finer clarification of waste is key to 

	establishing distinctions between value-adding activity, waste and 

	non-value-adding work. Non-value adding work is waste that must be done 

	under the present work conditions. One key is to measure, or estimate, the 

	size of these wastes, to demonstrate the effect of the changes achieved and 

	therefore the movement toward the goal.

Continuous Improvement

The "flow" (or smoothness) based approach aims 

	to achieve Just -In-Time (JIT), by removing 

	the variation caused by work scheduling and thereby provide a driver, 

	rationale or target and priorities for implementation, using a variety of 

	techniques. The effort to achieve JIT exposes many

	quality problems 

	that are hidden by buffer stocks; by forcing smooth flow of only 

	value-adding steps, these problems become visible and must be dealt with 

	explicitly.

The 

	Three Broad Types of Waste
The elimination of waste is the goal of

	Lean. 


Toyota 

	defined 

	three broad types of waste: muri,  mura and 

	muda.
 

     
Muri is all the unreasonable work that management imposes on 

	workers and machines because of poor organization, such as carrying heavy 

	weights, moving things around, dangerous tasks, even working significantly 

	faster than usual. It is pushing a person or a machine beyond its natural 

	limits. This may simply be asking a greater level of performance from a 

	process than it can handle without taking shortcuts and informally modifying 

	decision criteria. Muri also includes bad working conditions, and it will 

	often push a resource to work harder than its natural limits.  Unreasonable work is almost always a cause of multiple 

	variations.
Mura is the variation and 

	inconsistency in quality and volume in both products and human conditions.

Muda is the Japanese word for 

	waste. 

	It specifies it specifies any human activity, which absorbs resources, but 

	does not directly add 



customer value. 

	These non-value-adding 

	activities and results 

		 overproduction, waiting, transportation, inventory, motion, 

	over-processing, defective units  

	are to be eliminated.

That would be my home! I have to say that this may be one of my favorite junking experiences ever...and that speaks volumes. We had an outrageously good time, shooting, writing, creating, and producing this DVD for you. I hope you have as much fun watching it as we did making it! The cover price is a bargain at $12.99. The contents will totally give you an upper-hand on how to cut costs and raise the coolness meter at the same time.

This article appeared in the November 13, 1998 issue of Executive Intelligence Review.

October 30, 1998


				The presently threatening global tragedy can be summed up in a few words: up to the present moment, President Bill Clinton "doesn't know diddly about economics." Therefore, our nation's captain, Bill Clinton, out of his ignorance of economics seamanship, is desperately trying to save the doomed "Titanic," when his concern ought to be saving this planet's imperilled passengers, and himself.

			

				Thus, when he should be focussed upon a real crisis, the immediately perilous, world-wide food crisis in Russia, and elsewhere, which is now threatening to blow up immediately, the President's attention is gripped by a G-7 Hallowe'en fantasy spectacle, in which he is joined with Margaret Thatcher look-alike Tony Blair, and others, all in an obscene carnival, intended to muster popular support for a soon-to-be-nonexistent-in-any-case international financial system--the relevant "Titanic" of this situation. The President, with his new-found male bonding with Blair, is, thus, lured from reality, into a dream-like quest for that miraculous incantation which will make foolish people "feel better" about the crisis, even if only momentarily, even if the end result is to make everything much worse than if the G-7 had done nothing at all.

			

				Since the series of Washington conferences he called, earlier this month, the President has fled from the very reality he had presented in his September 14th address to the New York Council on Foreign Relations. Between the time of the September 23rd surfacing of the LTCM panic, and the Social-Democratic electoral victory in Germany, the President flinched; he capitulated to his fears of those Wall Street and London powers he had enraged by his New York address, and fled into the ostensibly protective embrace of his fellow "Third Way" ideologues from western Europe. Since the beginning of October, he has been obsessed with virtually pretending that he had never said what he freely admitted to be the case in his September 14th address. Since early October, instead of facing reality, he has been wasting precious time and resources, which ought to be spent on more useful activities, helping to make a monstrous crisis worse.

			

				During this recent period, the President has joined the official fools of Britain and France, with apparent support from the new government in Germany, in seeking yet another, ultimately disastrous short-term "crisis-management" scheme and mass-media hype, all for no better purpose than a short-lived effort to deny reality for yet another few more days. Thus, we have the sillier politicians being used once again, in yet another bankrupt bankers' attempt at a short-term bail-out for their incurably bad choice of investments. Thus, all for the sake of Alan Greenspan's and Eddie George's bankers, we have another G-7 scheme to force the widows and orphans of the world, to give up their last few pennies, and also their children's blood, in a futile attempt to bail out a financial empire of the IMF, which, in any case, is already, hopelessly doomed.

			

				Unfortunately, even those cruel, wildly hare-brained bail-out schemes, are far from the worst danger lurking within the President's recent folly.

			

				The central ideological feature of these October developments, has been the attempt to subordinate U.S. economic and foreign policies, to a "Third-Way" bonding of the President, to what, for a moment, at least, is a London-directed, "Dick" Morris-advised, G-7 coalition with Blair, Jospin, and the newly installed German Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder. Thatcher-look-alike Blair's influence on the issues of the present global financial crisis, is devilishly awful in its implications for even the near term. Unless the President realizes, soon, what an evil little Rumpelstiltskin Blair really is, the U.S.A. will discover, very soon, that it has been lured into the most deadly, global strategic trap of the century.

			

				However, for the moment, shove Blair himself back into his corner. Focus on the broader strategic and technical issues posed by the presently attempted "bail-out" package itself.

			

				Look first, at what the President purports to be doing about the financial crisis itself. Call it "the scheme," or, if you prefer, "the IMF's G-7 scam."

			

				Once again, we witness the typical feature of all similar "crisis management" schemes up till now. All current "crisis management" efforts can be reduced to an offering of financial bail-outs, which greatly increase the aggregate debts of the already monstrously insolvent debtors, but under the terms of agreements which collapse the debtor's future ability to repay. In previous such bail-out schemes, as now, the inevitable result is to drop the ability to pay the debts to much lower levels than prior to the previous crisis "just successfully managed." The present G-7 scam, has the same purpose as every bail-out swindle before it: to attempt to cover up the hopeless financial mess created by every similar bail-out scheme before.

			

				The pattern is identical to that in the celebrated New York case of what was once called "The Great Salad Oil Swindle," a case which I used, regularly, in my campus lectures, between 1966 and 1973, to explain how the new economic policies being launched in 1966, would blow out the financial system at some not-distant, future time.

			

				Decades before today, back in the saner times of President Kennedy's administration, accountants who approved of such arrangements would have been rightly booted out of the profession, or even justly jailed; today, since the "cultural-paradigm shift" of 1964-1972, that has become the standard practice of the IMF and the U.S. government, while the prisons are filled with the victims of prosecutors who are as crooked as, perhaps even more crooked than the worst of the past or present Wall Street accountants.

			

				In the aftermath of the Thatcher-Mitterrand-Bush-Gorbachev agreements of 1989-1991, there has been a recurrence of previous bail-outs of the same type as the G-7's current "trick or treat" diversion. Schemes like this, of the type launched since 1989-1991, notably including the terms dictated to Russia at the beginning of 1992, have already resulted in driving the physical economies of most nations of the world, repeatedly, either near to, or, sometimes, even beyond the breaking-point, the point at which they each have the choice of repudiating the debts, or dying in the futile effort to repay them. The lunacy of this week's G-7 declaration, shoves the world over the edge; this is the bail-out attempt which will not only fail, as inevitably as all those before it; this one could blow up the world.

			

				Then, look at the ominous strategic implications of repeating such childish games of "crisis management" at this historical, strategic juncture.

			

				The most difficult test for President Clinton, which will, to say the least, probably make or break the closing year of his administration, is the keystone role Russia's monstrous food crisis plays in the current, insane game being played by Britain's Blair government. For the irrationally exuberant Wall Street bankers, Brazil's is the crisis which threatens to topple them into Japan-style mass bankruptcies. It is the Russia crisis, a much smaller factor in the U.S. markets as such, which represents the more immediate, far more explosive, more deadly strategic potential. This Russia issue, together with London's cooked-up targetting of Malaysia, will hit Clinton head-on, strategically, and from both his foreign and domestic enemies, all at once, during the weeks immediately ahead.

			

				The crux of this Russia crisis, is the fact that Greenspan's and George's bankers, and others, are currently committed to forcing Russia, and President Clinton, to the folly of "staying the course" of the so-called "reform" policy. This is the policy, based on "free trade" and "globalization," which has already nearly destroyed Russia, and numerous other nations besides. It is also destroying the United States. No sane U.S. government would ever target Malaysia in the way Washington is doing now, nor, above all, allow such a game to be played against a desperate nation which is also the world's second-ranking thermonuclear power. This is but one immediate consequence the U.S. will soon face, unless it breaks with London and Blair on these and related matters of policy.

			

				The present conflict, over derivatives contracts, between London and Russia, is only the most immediately ominous of the rapidly expanding crises to be unleashed by the Hallowe'en follies of the G-7 group. For Brazil, as was the case for Indonesia, the conditions associated with the IMF's demands, are comparable to, or worse than the effects imposed by the Nazi looting of war-time occupied territories. In none of these cases, such as the recently announced G-7 agreement, have any of the governments duly considered the fact, that what the IMF did to Indonesia, and what the G-7 now proposes for both Russia and Brazil, among other nations, was called "crimes against humanity" in the post-war Nuremberg Trials of the Nazis.

			

				When such terms are dictated to states which have significant political and physical power to resist, even at great risk and the price of short-term sacrifice, the results are wars, or revolutions, or a combination of both. Proud nations so driven to despair, will, like the Biblical Samson, if they are able, pull down the pillars of the temple upon the tyrants who oppress them, rather than submit to such IMF-style sodomy. Under present world political and economic conditions, at a time when the stabilizing forces provided by perfectly sovereign nation-states are so greatly undermined by effects of "free trade" and "globalization," the present financial crisis, like the mid-Fourteenth Century bankruptcy of the Welf League's Lombard bankers, tends to set off chain-reactions like those of the "New Dark Age" of that century.

			

				Remember: According to the Nuremberg Code, any official of government, or any relevant professional otherwise, who knew, or should have known that the policies he crafts or implements will cause such effects on persons and nations, is guilty of capital offenses against humanity, and possibly also including the charge of war-crimes, if force is used to impose such policies or practices on unwilling nations. The application of such force, under present conditions, would be sufficient to set off something, on a global scale, otherwise echoing all of the most horrifying features of the "New Dark Age," the Spanish Nazi-like war against the Netherlands, and the 1618-1648 Thirty Years War.

			

				On this point, Clinton will either break with London on this and related issues, or he himself is likely to be sunk, and that very quickly. This is one problem which Bill Clinton could not "dialogue" his way out of. On this issue, he has no option, but to break out of "The Third Way."

			

				Look at the strategic alternative to the deadly follies of the new G-7 "crisis management" posture. Look at the implications of a strategically urgent "Food for Peace" policy.

			

				Whatever is decided in the case of Russia, now, during the current weeks, will immediately set the pattern for the world as a whole. The question is, therefore, can the President be awakened in time to turn the ship around?

			

				Technically, the solution for Russia's financial emergency, and its far more acute food emergency in particular, is elementary. Washington must take the lead in setting up a global agreement on a long-term credit-and-trade package. To succeed, this must include conceding Russia's right to the kinds of sovereignty which the U.S.A. practiced under President Franklin Roosevelt and all his patriotic predecessors. That means conditions more or less exactly like those prevailing under the pre-1958 form of the original Bretton Woods Agreements. This will require extensive, long-term use of capital and exchange controls, target-oriented trade agreements among the principal trading partners, and extensive other regulatory measures in the same spirit and genre. The presumptions of "free trade" and "globalization" must be immediately and totally abolished, otherwise no solution is possible.

			

				Under those strict preconditions, the successful package must feature a line of credit of not less than approximately ten years maturity, which will not only organize the immediate and continuing delivery of sufficient food supplies to Russia now, but, do that as an integral part of rebuilding that nation's agricultural and industrial potential to the profitable level at which its ability to repay its honorable debt is assured, but not gamblers' side-bets, such as financial derivatives. I shall return to treat the additional considerations later, here, below.

			

				Notably, the present conditions in Europe are worse than those which I anticipated when I first delivered an earlier form of this same "Food for Peace" program, as a leading feature of a nationally televised U.S. Presidential campaign address, which I had then just recently delivered in Berlin, Germany, on October 12, 1988, just over ten years ago. The notable added difficulty, today as compared to 1988, is that conditions throughout all of Europe, and also the U.S.A. itself, are far, far worse than they were in 1988. Then, the proposal was made with the purpose of preventing the kinds of conditions which presently exist throughout the Americas, and throughout both the eastern and western parts of Europe. Nonetheless, although the world has changed, very much for the worse, since that address, the much neglected principles of sound economic practice have not. The same principles still apply ten years later, even under presently prevailing world conditions far worse than almost any of the existing governments would have even imagined possible ten years ago.

			

				The point just stated must be underscored. In principle, the problem of integrating the territories of the former Soviet Union and other parts of eastern Europe, is no different in form today, than I envisaged and specified in my October 1988 "Food for Peace" statement. The only important difference, is that the conditions created by the 1989-1992 policy-dictates of Thatcher, Mitterrand, Bush, and Gorbachev, are much worse today, in both eastern and western parts of Europe, as in the U.S.A., than I or anyone else anticipated back in October 1988. The principles of economic recovery now, are the same, even though the means required will be more strenuous. With adequate leadership from key governments, ultimate success, if painfully achieved during the initial year of operations, is virtually assured.

			

				The "Food for Peace" package, in the form I propose it here, will provide the needed keystone for the entire architecture of a New Bretton Woods System. Now, as then, my proposal will establish a system of cooperation among a bloc of participating nation-states, which combined, will emerge immediately, inevitably, as the dominant influence on the affairs of our planet as a whole. It will be a system like that which President Franklin Roosevelt envisaged for post-war reconstruction. As I have already stressed, above, it must be premised upon a pre-ACDA (U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency), virtually Gaullist conception of the perfect sanctity of national sovereignty, and upon those modes of capital controls, exchange-controls, and financial and other regulation, including the combination of a fixed-rate monetary system, and protectionist modes of trade-agreements, which proved so successful during the crucial, 1946-1958 period of post-war economic reconstruction.

			

				As I have also noted, above, the included feature of any workable package, would be the termination of that so-called "reform"--featuring monetarist "free trade" and "globalization" conditionalities--which has systematically looted and destroyed Russia's, and many other nations' economies, during the recent nine years. Above all, if President Clinton is to prevent himself from running his ship of state onto the rocks just ahead, he must acknowledge, openly, that it was those "free trade" and "conditionalities" policies which have created the mess Russia and its creditors face now. If he fails to say this, virtually no one, in any part of the world, will, or should believe him.

			

				In the worst case, should the U.S. fail to turn to this alternative now, a terrible strategic condition will now rapidly develop around this planet, a situation more ominous than has existed on this planet at any earlier point during this century.

			

				The world would be divided between chiefly two forces, the one, a self-doomed Ship of Fools called the London-steered, present set of G-7 nations against those efforts at cooperation in survival, now variously erupting or simmering among some nations, probably including China, Russia, Malaysia, and soon many others. The latter nations will almost certainly decline to join the lunatics in that tasteless Hallowe'en spectacle otherwise known as the G-7's just-proclaimed economic mass-suicide-pact. Given existing conditions, now, and the physical-economic condition of nearly all parts of the world today, such a political state of affairs as this, means something far worse than war, even nuclear war.

			

				That just-proclaimed G-7 proclamation implicitly invokes an assault upon every part of the planet by the proverbial "Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse." Said otherwise, as I have already stressed, above, it is a result echoing, on a global scale, what is known as the mid-Fourteenth Century "New Dark Age," and what historian Friedrich Schiller's strategic studies describe as the brutish conditions of the Netherlands resistance against Hapsburg oppression, and the 1618-1648 Thirty Years War in Central Europe. Only the type of change I propose, if adopted very soon, could prevent such a holocaust of humanity as a whole.

			

				The President must now recognize, that we have now reached the point in the ongoing world financial crisis, at which either that FDR-style program based on long-term credit agreements, is put into operation immediately, without any of Blair's "global pre-agreements," his "new supranational authorities" nonsense; or else the U.S.A. and western Europe will be destroyed economically, destroyed by the chain-reaction effects of failing to adopt precisely such a policy pivotted on immediate solutions for Russia's immediate food crisis. It would be difficult to avoid repeating the warning, that the policies responsible for the recent decade of collapse in the world economy--chiefly the policies of "free trade" and "globalization," must be scrapped, and the conditions of cooperation among effectively sovereign nation-states re-established as the indispensable foundation for any possible general economic recovery on this ruined planet.

			

				For a standard of comparison to the present situation: Think of how foolishly stubborn the President was, for example, in refusing to admit publicly, that he had shown himself a fellow "who didn't know diddly about economics," when he made the virtually fatal political decision, to cave in to certain political advisors, such as perennial Presidential misadvisor "Dick" Morris, who were, and remain even far less competent in economics than he is, in dropping his plans to veto the 1996 "welfare reform" legislation being pushed by Newton "Yahoo" Gingrich. He must not repeat that kind of mistake, again, in the present, more deadly situation; unfortunately, that is precisely the error he has committed in his male-bonding act with Tony Blair & Company, on the issues of the current round of the global financial crisis.

			

				We can hope, that now, as in many happier, earlier outcomes in the history of crises, victory will be "snatched from the jaws of (virtually certain) defeat," as Lazare Carnot saved France during his period in command, 1792-1794. We must hope that somebody has the wits, guts, and stubbornness, to convince a responsible official to do what that official had been most stubbornly determined not to do. The success of such an effort can not be assured, unless a sufficient portion of our citizenry rallies to the fight now, rather than waiting until anyone could see that victory is assured. In this case, I am the most notable international public figure among those who are, or might prove qualified, on the record, to define the measures needed for ensuring a successful approach to the economic issues of the present crisis. In this matter, I have my unique capabilities and matching moral responsibilities, just as President Clinton has his unique duties, authorities, and responsibilities as head of state.

			

				That is what Presidents are for. Not to be manipulated by the cheap gossip of crooked pollsters, or by the Jacobin mobsters of today's compulsively calumniating, usually lying, dirty mass media. Rather, as civil-rights leaders from the 1960s recall, Presidents and their key officials, like members of Congress, must be constantly pressured, as the elected officials of true republics should be, not by public-opinion fluff and media-hype, but by the force of reasoning embodied in statements of fact and concern for principle presented by individual citizens.

			

				In this combination of circumstances, either I do the pushing on the needed economic strategy, with a lot of backing from concerned, responsible citizens, or both our incumbent President, his Vice-President, and this nation, are not going to continue to exist in a recognizable political form much longer. Either the President reverses course on this matter very soon, including his rejecting openly the philosophy expressed by his foolish mistake in choosing to support the 1996 "welfare reform;" or, if he lacks the wisdom to do so, the U.S. economy is going to take a deep, long dive, from which it might never recover, and this administration with it.

			

				Hey, buddy, I am not up here just yapping for your entertainment; I am addressing you personally, as a fellow who ought to be acting as a citizen of this republic. You must act as a real U.S. citizen, not as if you were merely some dumb, useless spectator, like those poor British subjects, with no true citizenship, traditionally gathered by the Speakers' Corner in London's Hyde Park. You have an unshirkable, personal responsibility, as a citizen, to determine how this drama plays out; your life may depend upon it. You wish to be a spectator? Pick up that shovel!

			

				Let each among our nation's well-wishers beware, that they not become one of those cowardly, foolish kind of kibbitzers who limit their responsibilities to making some "positive" suggestions, and then stand back, hands behind their back, like unemployed sidewalk superintendents, waiting to see whether their nation survives, or not. Let them not be yet another of those "free-loaders," who will not join the fight until the last opportunity to join the victory parade: "Believe me, if it works out, I will be the first to support it!" These, as Tom Paine said, "Are the times that try men's souls." For the United States, this is "Valley Forge" time once more; the fate of the republic is on the line. In such times, you are not permitted to be the kind of cheap kibbitzer, who has plenty of wisecracking complaints about the President's performance in the present situation, but backs off from challenging President Clinton's misguided opinions openly on important matters of policy, in which the President may be, temporarily, stubbornly wrong-headed.

			

				We are not going to induce the President to do anything right about the present situation, unless you, for one, participate in an effort which succeeds in pointing out, precisely and forcefully, where the President's current trends in economic policy-shaping are dead wrong. The President would be utterly incapable of understanding the kind of policy he should adopt on the Russia food crisis, unless he first understood where he is currently wrong in the choice of axiomatic presumptions which have prevented him from choosing a sane policy on Russia's economic disaster so far. Making little suggestions, without stating what must be corrected, is like the marriage counselor's suggesting the adoption of a mistress as a traditional solution for a marriage which has turned sour. At last, at least, the President must learn more than "diddly" about economics. You'd better succeed in helping to persuade him to choose that course, otherwise you will be too busy seeing your own miserable situation to notice the President's.

			

				Let us now turn, next, to the nature of the cretinism shown by each and all of those governments which signed onto the recent G-7 bail-out package. After that, we shall turn to two other crucial, related topics: 1) The specifics of the pilot agreement, with Russia, emphasizing the needed, axiomatic features, required to launch the New Bretton Woods System; and 2) How a man as capable in his field as Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin, could have rationalized the recently proclaimed G-7 doctrine. The answer to the second question may surprise you, but it represents a lesson which you, as a citizen must have learned, by the next time you are due to cast a vote.

			

				Don't let such examples as Prince Philip and Tony Blair mislead you; there are actually some very intelligent, and even some sane people to be found among the other subjects of the United Kingdom, although there are no citizens permitted there. In a letter to the editor of London's notorious Hollinger Corporation rag, the Daily Telegraph, published on Oct. 27th, one of these more intelligent Britons, Professor Stephen Bush--apparently no kin to that bubbleheaded, former U.S. President George Bush, who was Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's familiar in the follies of 1989-1992--made an elementary, and most relevant point, on the difference between costs of production and the expenditures, the latter necessary or not, for non-productive overhead. It is a point which President Clinton must heed, and learn, at long last.

			

				Professor Bush was responding, with appropriate, well-informed indignation, to an hysterical rant which had been published in the Telegraph's Oct. 22nd "City Comment" feature. Bush replied, " `City Comment' was wrong to suggest that `the four million people making things' contribute about the same to the `national economic cake' as a quarter million people in the City [of London financial center]. . . . It is an accounting fiction that the City `produces' 20 percent of our national output. Much of its so-called `output' consists of elaborate financial manipulation directed at attracting a disproportionate share of real output to itself. . . . Financial services and much of the City do not represent output--but are overhead costs on the output of the real economy. The fact that we have a higher proportion of our labour force engaged in services than any other economy is a weakness, not a strength. Viewing Britain as an economic enterprise, we should be doing our utmost to reduce, not expand this overhead."

			

				That was nice. Professor Bush's reference to the distinction between productive cost and overhead expense, is an appeal to nothing other than that good sense generally practiced by successful production managements and their qualified cost accountants, up to approximately the mid-1960s. Unfortunately, since the travesty known as the first Harold Wilson government, the glory has departed the body economic in many nations, not only in the British Isles. Today's typical monetarist, or his dupe, in the British Isles, on Alan Greenspan's Wall Street, or elsewhere, does not know--probably does not care--"diddly" about the difference between production costs and overhead expenses.

			

				According to his public utterances on the economy, neither, so far, does President Bill Clinton. In the Lotus Land of "post-industrial" utopia, otherwise known as "information society," the overhead is increased, while, in the unacknowledged, but real world, such policies result in the savaging of productive costs, while the banks, sooner, rather than later, go bankrupt as a result.

			

				By increasing the proportional allotment to eminently dispensable, grossly redundant, or outrightly parasitical services categories, such as financial services, the overhead of the national enterprise is skyrocketted, while the investment in increase of the per-capita physical-productive powers of labor, and related production costs, is relatively collapsed. In former times, such a policy was called folly, management incompetence, and usually ended in bankruptcy proceedings. Today, it is called, perversely, "growth" in employment and of financial turnover; but, as the case of LTCM should remind us, it still leads to the same old result as before: bankruptcy.

			

				Therefore, Professor Bush's criticism of the Daily Telegraph, could be summed up in a few simpler words. The Old Testament called it "onanism;" today's monetarists, and other illiterates misname it "economics." Recognize that the hallmark of poor Margaret Thatcher's screeching-nanny style in dottiness, was the fact that her education as Prime Minister had never reached the stage at which she was able to distinguish the difference, between manipulating mere symbols ("onanism"), and acting on the real-life objects to which the symbols were attached as mere names. In other words, economics mass-pornographer Thatcher was never observed to have recognized the difference between the mere symbols deployed to produce an all too cleverly crafted financial statement, and the physical reality which that statement misrepresented to the dupes.

			

				On this account, Tony Blair has distinguished himself as having succeeded in his attempt to carry the political handbag of such a symbol-minded, and dangerous fool as Thatcher. Blair's pathetic sophistry, which commonly distinguishes that pitiable pair, is a form of, quite literally, schizophrenic word-play,[1] which is called, variously, "The Third Way," "The Third Wave," "The Middle," or, more appropriately named, "Middle Earth." They are, as Professor Bush, most circumspectly, implies the writer of the relevant Daily Telegraph piece to be, "batty," "addle-pated," "loony," "a quack," simply "freakish," or, like the insufferable Thatcher, simply "nuts."

			

				In the case of Mad Nanny Thatcher, her political style was to attach ill-placed moral importance, in her awfully loud and most painfully unmusical, ranting way, to her reading of financial symbols, and to attribute turpitude to anyone so rude as to focus attention on the effects her policies had on real-life people in real-life economy. Her Britain was a monetarist's version of Lewis Carroll, in which "The Red Queen" reigned, whose Parliament is an eternal tea-party, in which Thatcher played the "Mad Hatter," in which her successors, John Major and Tony Blair, have taken their turns at the part of the "Dormouse." Whether Brutish is translated either into a Hobbit's Danish, or the currently popular American Slanguage, such is the "Middle Earth" fantasy in which the part of the fictional Golem is played by the "Third Way's" Dick Morris.[2]


				So much for the nuts; what about sane economists? What, at a minimum, must President Clinton learn about the practical, real-life definitions of economics terms such as "productive costs" and "overhead expense"? Professor Bush's retort to the Daily Telegraph provides a useful point of departure, for clearing up the more elementary among the points to be made here.

			

				"Productive costs" signify the price put upon physical products which are needed to sustain the average physical-productive powers of the national labor-force as a whole, at its present, or improved operating level. This includes the costs of everything which must be provided to meet that productivity requirement, including maintenance and improvement of basic economic infrastructure. It includes the costs of materials, semi-finished products, capital goods, and so forth, for agriculture, industry, and the physical distribution of goods. It includes those costs of engineering and related technical services to production and product design. It includes the costs of services directly to physical production and physical distribution of product. It includes all of those costs of household consumption, which are required to reproduce an educated labor-force at a level of technological aptitude higher than the present level of operations.

			

				"Expenses" signifies everything else, including the worst forms of sheer wastefulness.

			

				With a qualification to be added here, the general definition of "productive costs," is everything bearing directly upon the entire society's physical relationship, through physical production, to nature, to the universe at large. The distinctions between kinds of productive costs, and among varieties of overhead and other expenses, are located within the area of distinction between maintaining a society's levels of both technology and productivity, at no worse than present levels, and, in the alternative, effecting coordinate advances in both technology and the physical productivity of the society's labor-force considered as a unified whole.

			

				In competent economics, as in the scientific method of Plato and his Academy, and in all notions of culture, the concept of change, especially genuinely revolutionary qualities of scientific, technological, and political change, is always everything of primary importance. By "revolutionary," we should understand new discoveries of principle which have been supplied a crucial form of validation, as principles, either by rigorous methods of experimental physics, or by equivalent forms of rigor in the domains of Classical art-forms and statecraft.

			

				In modern economy, and implicitly in inferior economic cultures, too, the emphasis is upon the increase of the per-capita physical productivity of the society's labor-force considered as an indivisible whole. Thus, on this account, we must minimize expenses; yet, there are certain kinds and rations of social expense, without which the per-capita physical productivity of the labor-force as a whole would decline, or could not be significantly improved. Thus, all applicable forms of economic science are focussed upon the functional nature of the kind of "optimization" problem thus implied.

			

				Similarly, to maintain the potential per-capita productivity of the labor force as a whole, it is necessary to increase the real content of wages and other direct and indirect costs of production, even simply to maintain sufficient rates of increase of productivity to offset attrition. To improve productivity more significantly, the real content of per-capita wages and other per-capita direct and indirect costs, must be increased at significant rates. In such matters, if the society is well-managed, the gains in physical output per capita will increase more rapidly than the growth of the direct and indirect costs required to effect this gain in both gross and net physical output per capita. This optimization problem is multiply interconnected, functionally, to the general optimization problem identified in the preceding paragraph.

			

				That is the core of the challenge represented by the work of applied economic science.

			

				In its long sweep, the history of civilization, and the pre-history of cultures, too, is defined, for introductory and general classroom purposes, by a two-by-two matrix. The first column might be titled "principles." This would be composed of two qualities of crucial principles: physical principles, and principles of social relations governing the organization of the society's physical relationship to the universe. The second column, would be headed "realization," signifying the relative development of the application of the crucial principles known to that society.

			

				The applicable, working definition of such qualities of principles is elementary. Here, we encounter the essential interrelationship between physical economy and general education within the society. In a competent educational program (admittedly of the quality which the U.S. no longer has today), the primary task of education is to guide the pupils through reliving original discoveries of principle, most emphatically physical principles and principles of composition integral to Classical art-forms. Take the simpler challenge first, that of physical principles.

			

				It is that quality of education, from the elementary level, to the level often ironically identified as preparation for the professional mind's "terminal degree," which enables the pupil to identify principles not with contents of textbooks and similar sources, but, rather with the student's own re-enactment, within the sovereign precincts of his, or her own mind, of the most generally relevant and other validated original discoveries of principle. By reliving the act of validated original discovery, contributed by--often--a named original discoverer from even centuries or more earlier, the student has relived the high points of the intellectual life of mankind to date.

			

				At any point in human scientific progress, all of the known, and rigorously implied discoveries of physical principle available, as knowledge, to a specific society, form a knowable but unknown total number of physical-space-time "dimensions," which can be designated by the symbolic number "n." Unlike a crude, aprioristic form of Euclidean, or Cartesian geometry, each and all of these principles combine as interactive, as elements of a multiply-connected, or hypergeometric manifold, as Kepler first defined the Solar system, and Leibniz, Gauss, and Riemann after him. We mention this seemingly sophisticated point here, because it has a most direct, most specific, and indispensable practical bearing on the design of the needed "Food for Peace" package.

			

				The point is, that, contrary to quacks such as the late John von Neumann, or the recently notorious case of Merton and Scholes, there is no purely mathematical, e.g., aprioristic form of physical science, or physical economy in particular. All "dimensions" in physical science are principles of an expandable, n-fold multiply-connected manifold. This works to such effects as the fact that there is a characteristic relationship, which defines the significance of any one measurable principle of action, in light of the experimentally measurable interaction of that principle with the other principles. This multiply-connected interaction defines all physical science, as intrinsically non-linear, which is to say, never linear in the infinitesimally smallest interval of action. This principle of non-linearity, so defined, is the most essential principle of all modern science, and is absolutely crucial for all understanding of how economic processes either actually work, or fail to perform adequately.

			

				We come now to the most crucial, and the most sophisticated point at issue. Without addressing this issue, no competent appreciation of the subject of economy in general, or of the problems posed by the current crisis, were possible. Thus, it would be damnably immoral recklessness, of any relevant professional, or official of government, to evade the subject to which we now turn, merely on the pretext of "I prefer not to go there." The point at issue is: what principle determines whether a modern economy works, or, like the present world economy, does not? The issue is, "Doctor-economist, and you, too, Mr. President of this economy: what failure in your practice, is responsible for the fact, that all the patients in your establishment are dying?"

			

				The issues so situated are key to the competent design of any escape from the doom implicit in the presently ongoing, downward spiral of systemic, global financial collapse. The design of a competent general form of a Food for Peace program, depends upon these same considerations. A certain amount of challenge to the reader's mental powers, is required to understand these connections, but, more to the point, such acquired comprehension is indispensable for competent policy-shaping, under the conditions of the presently spiralling succession of functional phase-shifts in the global economy as a whole. We now proceed accordingly.

			

				That question just posed, is one which belongs chiefly to a specific area of economic practice, the domain of long-range economic forecasting, the specialty in which I enjoy virtually unmatched success. In contrast to my successes, the general source for the crucially demonstrated, common incompetence of virtually all leading contemporary economists in the area of medium- to long-range economic forecasting, is the same axiomatic blunder of method common to the intrinsic incompetence of the work of François Quesnay, Adam Smith, David Ricardo, J.M. Keynes, Karl Marx, and John von Neumann's ultra-simplistic notion of the application of formal solutions of sets of simultaneous linear inequalities.

			

				The latter case, von Neumann's, is the key to locating the source of the intrinsic incompetence of the thinking behind the catastrophic blunder of Merton and Scholes, and of nearly every leading banker, and central banker, of the world today, Alan Greenspan most notably included. The same incompetence shown by von Neumann's entire work in economics, is the axiomatic fraud of von Neumann's fellow radical positivist, Norbert Wiener, in concocting the negentropy hoax central to his information theory.

			

				This general class of indicated blunders of most of the most popular names in today's academic economics curriculum, is key to the floundering incompetence characteristic of all but a few among those contemporary economists addressing the problem posed by the present crisis. To sum it all up, it is fairly said, that these economists have been unable to distinguish between an economy conducted by human beings, and one by monkeys. Among these are the economists who, in effect, have been attempting to make a monkey out of President Clinton, at least so in matters bearing upon the present financial crisis and the economic situation generally.

			

				It is the cornerstone of the entirety of my relatively unique success in economic forecasting, that no species of higher apes--nor Adam Smith, Ricardo, Marx, or von Neumann--is capable of simulating, conceptually, the most characteristic trait of a successful phase of an economy's existence. My own pedagogical focus upon the most characteristic feature of Marx's incompetence, on this point, is applicable to all other cases relevant to the problems implicitly posed by President Clinton's recent, potentially catastrophic policy-blunder on the subject of the present global financial crisis.

			

				Karl Marx's four-volume Capital does claim the existence of a principle of successful, anti-entropic growth in modern economy. He locates this matter under the topic of "extended reproduction." The supposed elaboration of his exposition to that effect, occupies the closing portions of his Volume II and the opening portions of Volume III. However, Marx buries the issue of the origins of this anti-entropic performance, under a floundering heap of crude, epiphenomenological mystifications on the subject of labor, thus mimicking Smith's Invisible Hand. On this same point, all other economists rooted in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries' British East India Company's Haileybury School, are worse bunglers than Marx on this specific point. The crudest and worst of the currently influential schools of epiphenomenological mumbo-jumbo, on this account, are the dogmas of "free trade" put forward by the Mont Pelerin Society, and such appendages and fellow-travellers of that Society as the Heritage Foundation, American Enterprise Institute, and House resident economics quack-doctor Newt Gingrich.

			

				In Marx's Capital, the root of the failure of his so-called "materialist method," is expressed by his pervasive evasion of the issues of "the technological composition of capitals." The same pervasive fallacy of Marx's method, is carried to extremes by the relatively cruder misconception of the specific difference between the nature of the human species and the higher apes, as offered by the perverse Friedrich Engels. Essentially, the more generally relevant issue of fact posed by Marx's exemplary blunder, is this. Under the range of ecological conditions which have existed on this planet during approximately two millions years to date, the highest potential population-density for all possible species of higher apes, combined, would not exceed several millions individuals. In short, there is no possibility, that the human species is functionally definable, in terms of animal ecology, as a species of higher ape. Mankind is the only known species which has been capable of willfully increasing the potential relative population-density of its own species as a whole.

			

				Elementary physical-economy studies show that the willful increases of our species' potential relative population-density, occur only in a characteristically anti-entropic mode. The most obvious correlative of such anti-entropic phase-shifts in characteristics of human behavior, is the effect of scientific and technological progress. Thus, the beginning of the elaboration of a science of physical economy, is the examination of the functional relationship between the human mind and nature, in these specific terms of reference.

			

				With a friendly nod to England's Professor Bush, we can say, as a matter of first approximation, that we can measure such anti-entropic features of successful phases of economic processes, in terms of the correlation between an increase of the rate of profit of such economies as a whole, and a necessary increase of the total per-capita costs of the production which generates such a growth in net physical-economic output.

			

				Furthermore, study of modern technology shows the direct connection between validated discoveries of physical principles, and the increase of the net productive powers of the whole labor-force, through the application of technologies derived from those physical principles. This connection is in no sense the "hand-waving" or other sort of mystical, statistical inference supplied by such as Bernard Mandeville, Adam Smith, Marx, et al. The functional connection is fully transparent, each step of the way, from the paradox which leads to an hypothetical discovery of physical principle, through the crucial-experimental validation of that physical principle, and the ensuing derivation of families of machine-tool-design principles from study of the perfected crucial, proof-of-principle experiment, including its instrumentation. It is the introduction of products and improved productive processes, each derived directly from application of families of these new machine-tool and cognate designs, which is the relevant action generating an anti-entropic form of increase of the physical-economic net increase of the per-capita productive powers of labor. So far, all transparent.

			

				So far, so good; but, this step is only a preliminary one. What this preliminary success leaves unresolved, is two things. First: The agency of validatable individual discoveries of physical principle, and the willful development of that agency, remains to be adequately defined here. Second: The qualitative changes in the social organization of the physical-economic process, the qualitative change in such organization indispensable for the generation and implementation of discoveries of new physical principles, must also be defined. These additional challenges bring us from the domain of physical principles as such, to the expression of that same quality of individual creativity seen in the discovery of new physical principles, as principles located in the clearest form within the domain of Classical art-forms, such as Classical forms of poetry, drama, music, and plastic arts. It is only when we recognize the two leading expressions of individual human creativity: validated discovery of new physical principles, and validated discoveries of new principles in Classical art-forms, that we have located the driving force behind the human species' unique capability for willful, anti-entropic increase of its potential relative population-density.

			

				This, in turn, requires a demystification of the fact that the principles of creativity associated with Classical art-forms, are efficient agencies affecting the domain of physical principles. The fact, that man's per-capita power in the universe requires not only validatable new physical principles, but also validatable principles expressed by Classical art-forms, obliges us to locate the essential feature of economic processes in those qualities of the individual mind which are expressed equally by validatable discoveries of both physical and artistic principles.

			

				Examining the common connection between these two areas of creativity, as the common expression of a single quality specific to the matured mind of an individual member of the human species, will lead us, in turn, back to that most fundamental principle of physical economy upon which competent long-range forecasting depends. That same principle is key for specifying the requirements of a general economic-recovery program and policy, under the present extraordinary global condition.

			

				The best example of the way in which Classical-artistic principles efficiently interact with physical principles, is the case of the emergence of well-tempered Classical motivic thorough-composition (as of Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Brahms, et al.), rooted in the preceding discoveries of J.S. Bach, from proximate beginnings in Leonardo da Vinci's systematization of certain essential principles of Florentine bel canto modes of voice-training and polyphonic singing. The most essential features of that connection are summarized, as briefly as possible here, to show the relevant aspects of the interconnection between physical and other species of cultural principles, within the successful practice of modern economy.

			

				The earliest knowledge we have of attempts to approximate what we term today a well-tempered scale, dates from the references to Pythagoras' role in connection with the notion of the "comma," and discussions of such a tempered scale from the time of Plato and his Academy. The earliest well-defined knowledge of the roots of a natural (i.e., well-tempered) scale, pertains to the principles of vocalization of Vedic-Sanskrit poetry, a subject which must be correlated with Leonardo da Vinci's treatment of this subject in respect to the Florentine Italian of Dante Alighieri, Petrarch, et al.[3]


				Through the development of polyphonic composition, leading from Leonardo et al., into the work of J.S. Bach, the six-voice natural division of the chest of bel canto singing voices, became the physical foundation upon which Bach developed a cross-voice polyphony based on a principle of multiply-connected inversions, leading into such exemplary works as his A Musical Offering and The Art of the Fugue. It was the intensive study of the implication of Bach's A Musical Offering, by W.A. Mozart, a discovery probably prompted by an earlier development by Joseph Haydn,[4] which launched that revolution in musical composition known as Classical motivic thorough-composition, as typified by the revolutionary Fourth Symphony of Johannes Brahms.

			

				Thus, while the development of Classical polyphony, is specifically a matter of experimentally demonstrated principles of composition and performance within the domain of Classical art, its characteristics are rooted in, multiply-connected with, the naturally, biologically determined physiology of both the human singing-speaking voice, and with the auditory and cognitive mental processes of hearing. Thus, while we are obliged, for obvious practical reasons, to distinguish between physical and artistic/cultural principles, we can not overlook the highly efficient way in which both domains are interconnected, including crucial economic interconnections.

			

				Two additional points must be noted here, respecting cultural principles. First, as the case of Classical motivic thorough-composition illustrates the case, the principles of such musical composition are principles in the same sense, and with the same precision, that we use the same term for crucial-experimentally validated physical principles.[5] Thus, the interconnected combination of "n" physical principles and "m" cultural principles, defines a multiply-connected manifold "n+m."[6] Second, what is indicated as an "n+m" manifold, is associated with a characteristic, infinitesimal rate of "non-constant curvature," which defines the trajectory of the social process (i.e., economy) as a whole.

			

				This latter feature of the economic process, is the most crucial determinant of that economy's relative performance. It is, correspondingly, changes in that characteristic, which define the changes in the relative performance of the economy as a whole.

			

				Although our knowledge of this sort of "n+m" manifold is not sufficiently developed in detail to permit certain kinds of estimates to be made, the impact of changes in discovered physical principle, and of related derivations of new technologies, is rather well known. On the latter account, our knowledge is sufficient to guide us in respect to estimating the relative benefit of certain types of proposed changes in the manifold, and also in respect to the implications of the application of those changes.

			

				We must never overlook the fact, that the realization of potential advantages to be obtained from validated discoveries of physical principle, depends upon the impact of application, or lack of application of cultural principles. Use a commonplace problem in musical performance, to illustrate the connection.

			

				At a certain level, some musical performers become accomplished in performing notes, but the combined effect of their performing all of the notes of a particular composition, leaves enormous room for improvement, before we could even consider blaming the composer for the effect of that performance. Exemplary are personally "stylized," Romantic and other misinterpretations of Classical compositions, such as a Beethoven work in which the performer demonstrates nothing so perfectly as his lack of knowledge of the conception underlying the composer's intended unity of effect.[7]


				The primary sources show, in numerous cases, that a composer such as Wolfgang Mozart or Beethoven, began a composition with a momentary flash of insight, which was subsequently elaborated as a fully developed composition. This evidence is consistent with the internal characteristic which unifies a richly elaborated work as representing a single, underlying musical conception. In motivic thorough-composition, most emphatically, the meaning of the composition is lodged within a sequence of contrapuntally ordered changes in state, each state effected in the quality of an original discovery.

			

				The purblind, but technically proficient performer, emphasizes the interpretation of each sensuous element in a succession of states, rather than focussing the performance, as, for example, Wilhelm Furtwängler did, on the process of transition, placing the composition, in effect, as existing "between the notes." Attack, coloration, slight rubato, and so on, bring Schubert's Ninth Symphony to life, a seamless, constantly pulsating developmental process, from beginning to close, whereas a skilled, but less insightful conductor, brings a mere monotony to the passages where relentless tension of ongoing development surges in the composer's and the greatest conductor's direction. It is in that aspect of the great Classical composition, that the principle expressed as the idea of the composition lies.[8]


				Thus, the physical-technical aspects of performance have a great importance, but those technical qualities, without the necessary cultural insight into the non-linear process of compositional development, produce a deadening effect. Or, for lack of any competent insight into the idea upon which the composer based his work, a purely arbitrary "interpretation" is applied instead. It is the same in economics; the cultural principles of society's development, must be the agency which employs the relevant physical principles.[9]


				We come thus to that relevant principle, which is indispensable for the economist, in situating the considerations just outlined.

			

				Carl Gauss's unique solution for determining the orbits of three principal asteroids, refutes, crucially, still today, all of the opponents of Kepler's work. It demonstrated the principle, that the empirical assessment of an infinitesimally small interval of non-constant (non-linear) curvature of the trajectory of a process, defines the entire trajectory of the process of which that infinitesimal interval of action is a part. It was Kepler's discovery of a trans-transcendental quality of non-constant curvature of this kind, on which he based his specifications for a future development of a calculus crafted to deal with the implications of axiomatic non-linearity of action in characteristic, infinitesimally small intervals. This calculus, which is premised upon non-linearity of action in the infinitesimally small (the Leibniz differential), was developed, uniquely, by Gottfried Leibniz, and no other.[10] This work of Kepler, Leibniz, and their co-thinkers, was what was proven conclusively by the crucial features of Gauss's determination of the Keplerian orbit of the asteroid Ceres.

			

				This same principle of hypergeometry, as further developed by Riemann, after Gauss, is crucial for an applied science of physical economy. After we have taken into account all the nice considerations implicitly referenced by Professor Bush's letter, there remains one fundamental question of science, without which economics is unable to develop the kinds of predictive capabilities needed for long-range forecasting, or for methods of long-range policy-planning on which projects such as a ten-year span of revolving credit must be based, which must be employed to meet the challenges associated with the presently urgently needed Food for Peace program. Without addressing that fundamental question of science, attempted forecasting remains, as Mrs. Joan Robinson justly ridiculed the squirrelly Professor Milton Friedman, an ordinary accountant's typical projections: essentially mere post hoc ergo propter hoc projections of no intrinsic scientific, or even elementary school quality of rational merit.[11] The essential issue here, is the required, accelerating rate of anti-entropic growth in scale and per-capita rates of growth of the productive powers of labor, which must be secured, to ensure the future ability to pay, upon which the needed form and scale of a system of credit depends.

			

				On this account, the infinitesimal interval of non-linear action upon which the trajectory of the entire economic process depends, is the generation, or replication of valid physical and artistic principles, which occurs only within the sovereign confines of the cognitive (creative) processes of the individual mind. Such knowledge, by its nature, can not be transmitted as mere "information;" only scientific and economic illiterates, or quacks, could suggest that this is merely a matter of transmitting "information." Every qualified school teacher knows better than to imagine that the issue is "information."

			

				Hence, the crucial importance of eradicating recently popularized educational policy, and replacing those mind-deadening practices, with a return to, and enhancement of the principles of Classical humanist education associated with the pre-1684 Massachusetts Bay Colony,[12] and the Humboldt-influenced reforms of U.S. secondary education by Alexander Dallas Bache.[13] Furthermore, the entire economic policy of the U.S. in particular, must be premised on precisely such use of the methods of Classical humanist education (as distinct from the morally debased "secular humanist" policies).

			

				In Classical humanist education, the primary and secondary pupil, and university student, learns nothing except by re-enacting, in as historically exact a replication as possible, the experience of the exact paradox, which led a discoverer of the past to generate what he established, by crucial-experimental methods, as a valid physical principle, or principle of composition of Classical art-forms.

			

				In former times, European Classical humanist education, was defined by an emphasis upon both Classical Greece, strictly defined, but including the continuation of the influence of Plato's Academy up to approximately the time of Eratosthenes and Archimedes. The Homeric epics, the poem of Solon of Athens, the tragedies of Aeschylus and Sophocles, and the work of Socrates, Plato, and their collaborators, were presented to the pupils as the origins of European civilization, emerging out of roots in chiefly Greek culture's debt to Egypt and Egypt-associated Cyrenaica. For the pupil so educated, the history of ideas, especially ideas of physical and Classical-artistic principles, and related ideas and topics of statecraft, was treated as a continuation of what began in the emergence of Classical Greece. That was the functional meaning of "Classical" in education and in art, until the vulgarization of the term, by illiterates, during recent times.

			

				The literate classroom did not teach "information." Mere "information" was for the so-called "blab schools," of such places of residence of strictly marginal labor-force, as among impoverished, downtrodden, rural Appalachian regions, whose victims were kept down, barely above the dirt-floor level of chattel slavery. The literate classroom taught ideas, in programs which emphasized the student's re-enactment, as faithfully as possible, of the original, valid discovery of physical principles and comparable principles of composition of Classical art-forms. Classical drama, Classical poetry, Classical music and voice-training, and history taught from the standpoint of re-enactment of discoveries of both physical principles and principles of Classical composition, were the content of a serious education of a person qualified to function as a citizen of a republic. Education shaped to the envisaged future employment of the student, belongs where the livestock are kept, not in the places where actual human beings are developed in their individual cognitive powers.

			

				A literate student, does not communicate "information;" "information" is pseudo-education supplied to those strata "tracked" to become the mass of marginalized Yahoos. "Information," like today's popular mass entertainment, has been deployed as the modern successor to those "bread and circuses" policies of ancient imperial Rome, by means of which the brutalized proletarians of Rome and, later, Byzantium, were managed, and also culled.

			

				The literate student induces another to re-enact the experience of generating the discovery of a valid principle. Such principles can not be known through the mere transmission of "information;" knowledge is limited to one's first-hand experience in generating discoveries, or rediscoveries of valid principles. A person educated to "process information received," is, by definition, cheap labor, qualified to little better than slave labor, not a qualified, productive member of a modern labor-force.

			

				Thus, a successful economy, is one organized around education and fundamental scientific research, as these are defined by the Classical humanist modes of education we have just outlined here. In science and technology, the pivotal features of the secondary and university curriculum, are the respective pedagogical and research laboratories, where past discoveries are re-enacted, or original new discoveries are in progress. This educational activity of the population as a whole, is integrated with the economy as a whole, through science-driver programs whose impetus is supplied by government, as the successful Kennedy space-program illustrates the case. Only such an education-centered economic policy, can generate the rates of increase of the productive powers of labor, needed to meet the challenge presented by the cumulative decay and other devastation caused by approximately thirty years of willful, moral and economic degeneration of our institutions, our enterprises, and most of our population. Only on this basis, can we, in the relatively more developed areas of the world, supply the technological and related impetus required, to meet the challenge represented by the underdevelopment of Asia, and looting of Central and South America, and the genocide against Africa, which the tradition of the former colonial powers has bestowed upon the majority of humanity today.

			

				All economic policy-shaping today, must begin with the recognition, that money, in the form it exists today, is becoming, rapidly, virtually worthless, especially the money on the books of the most powerful financial institutions of North America, Japan, and western Europe.

			

				The total claims on the account of worthless paper, as typified by those gamblers' side-bets called "derivatives," is many times the combined nominal Gross Domestic Product of all nations of the world--perhaps as much as $150 trillions or more. Buddy, that is a debt no one could bail out; it must be written off as paper with no legal standing. Let party and counter-party make what trade-offs of claims as they will, and let governments referee the resulting brawl; but, not a penny of taxpayers' assets, of any nation, should be poured down that rathole. It must be written off. Perhaps $150 trillions of that trash should be written off, in "one swell foop."

			

				The awful crunch, which almost no one wishes to believe will happen, is coming down soon, and fast. The shock, and resulting hysteria, of being confronted with the awful reality they had wishfully assured themselves would "never be allowed to occur," is the greatest likely internal and other source of threats to national security. On this account, as well as for moral reasons, the paramount, and first concern of our Federal government, in launching the needed rescue operation, shall be to protect the proverbial "little guy," and to maintain essential employers, including essential banks, in operation.

			

				Freeze honorable debt which can not be paid now, for future resolution, and as part of the mechanism for recycling credit. Bail out the "little guy," to the extent that we maximize the relative number of our citizens who are able to stand on their own feet in respect to the daily routine of their economic and financial affairs.

			

				The thing most to be feared, is the kind of greed-driven, "every man for himself" anarchy, which can engender a Hobbesian sort of more or less homicidal chaos. The spirit of the "New Deal," reawakened from a long, nightmarish slumber, will promote that sense of general solidarity within the population, which is indispensable for rapid and successful economic reconstruction.

			

				In that moment of crisis, you must say to your fellow-citizen: "You are not going to starve. You are not going to be thrown in the street. You are not going to lack necessary medical care, or any other necessary thing a decent life requires."

			

				"Who says?" comes the reply.

			

				"This is not a matter of simply me to you. We, your fellow-citizens, who own this government under the Preamble of our Federal Constitution, are not going to allow that to happen to you, and you must join us in assuring that it is not allowed to happen to anyone else.

			

				"In the meantime, we have the ability to get back into the business of producing what our nation needs."

			

				When the time comes, you must say that, and you must mean it. On that moral principle of solidarity, in such times of crisis, under our Constitution's Preamble, the security of this nation depends absolutely. We must resolve, not to place the country ever again in the hands of moral degenerates such as the Mont Pelerin Society, the Gingriches, or the other so-called "social Darwinists." Resolve that, and mean it, or risk Hell on Earth.

			

				We apply the same principle of justice and solidarity toward other parts of the world. We gloat over no one's suffering, and turn our back on no part of suffering humanity. That is the principle, which, if observed, can keep this planet safe from what is otherwise inevitable during the short term immediately ahead. Without such principles of solidarity in action, this planet will virtually blow up very soon. That cautionary observation should be recognized as the premise of a program of "Food for Peace."

			

				That said, should clear the air. Thence, to the matter of the principled considerations of a "Food for Peace" program.

			
Principle 1: On the condition that a "geometric" rate of growth of both per-capita physical-economic output, and at least a constant positive ratio of gross to net output, can be foreseen, masses of long-term credit of indefinitely large scale, can be confidently issued, at low discount rates, to that customer (e.g., nation). This will be successful, even under the conditions that the ratio of net output is negative at the outset.

			

				In the case of Russia today, there are four leading factors which indicate confidence in the success of such cooperation, under the type of economic reconstruction projected by the Primakov government:

			
Natural Monopolies: The first of these is what Russia's official language identifies as "the natural monopolies," those associated with the processing of primary mineral resources and, also, large-scale infrastructure systems in mass transport, and in power generation and distribution. 

				
Machine-Tool Capabilities: Russia's residual capabilities in the former Soviet military-scientific industrial complex, represent one of the planet's largest existing potentials for production of advanced machine-tool-design capabilities. Under conditions of present trends of developments in China, and other relevant actually, or potentially rapidly developing nations, a massive and growing market exists for such products, a market which the combined machine-tool capabilities of the U.S.A., western Europe, and Japan could not begin to satisfy. This sector of Russia's economy is the core of that economy's ability to generate high rates of internal growth of the productive powers of labor, at rates even way above that of the former Soviet Union. 

				
Other Industrial Capabilities: Under protectionist measures of the type formerly traditional to the U.S.A., Russia's general industrial potential can be revived, expanded, and improved, in both quality of product and rates of productivity, to provide most of the net internal requirements of Russia's population, with aid of a revived military-scientific industrial complex, now functioning as a large and growing machine-tool-design sector. A protected industrial sector, represents a large market for the machine-tool and related export industries of the U.S.A., Germany, Japan, and other nations which have been traditional leaders in export of machine-tools and related engineering services. 

				
Basic Economic Infrastructure: As was the case in all periods of successful economic growth of the U.S.A. and Germany, for example, large-scale state-protected and regulated investments in developing basic economic infrastructure, are an absolute precondition for sustained growth of the productive powers of labor, per capita, in the nation as a whole. As in agriculture, these investments resemble preparation of the land for production and marketing of crops. The obstacle to be overcome, is the fact, that the direct pay-back for such improvements is delayed during the medium-term and initial long-term period. Nonetheless, without such improvements, the agro-industrial sector will fail to develop adequately. Meanwhile, the mobilization of labor for such projects, and the infrastructure itself, are the most important stimulants for the expansion of the market for the manufacturing and other traditional sectors of private ownership. On condition, that adequately long-term credit is supplied at sufficiently low rates, large-scale investments in development and maintenance of basic economic infrastructure have always proven themselves to be the largest factor in the successful expansion of the economy as a whole. 

				
Agriculture: Noting the exceptional case of Japan, and of similarly situated nations with little economically usable land-area, domestic self-sufficiency in essential food supplies is an absolute prerequisite for economic and other national security. The failures of agriculture, on this account, proved to be the Achilles' heel of the former Soviet Union. Now, the ability of Russia to bring its needed food-supplies and their prices under stable internal-market conditions and adequate volume, is crucial for Russia's ability to work its way out of the wrecked economic condition imposed upon Russia's economy, entirely, as a result of the foreign-dictated, hare-brained "reform" process of the recent eight years. 

				
A Revolutionary Added Option: What appears to be the least habitable, very large region of Russia's territory, the frozen north, is one of the most important markets in the world. With vast natural resources, which could not be tapped efficiently without systematic and extensive development, it represents the natural economic frontier of Russia's future, and, by its impact, one of the greatest boons to all of Asia. This area's development, together with the prospective future development of the Sahara, the Gobi Desert, and so on, must be conceived as the other side of the space-program. Like the space-program, the benefits of such an Arctic development effort, will contribute far more to the world's economies in the increase of the productive powers of labor through science and technology, than in the immediate effects of the development itself. This project, combined with the space-program, should be viewed as opening the windows to a revolutionary way of thinking, and acting, about the entirety of the Solar system in which we live. 

				
Principle 2: The failure of Russia's economy has been entirely the net result of the so-called "liberal reform" policies introduced, by direction of the G-7 powers, during the recent, approximately nine, years. To implement those destructive measures, the agents of the G-7 powers have placed, and maintained in power, a coterie of youthful bunglers and intellectual incompetents, sometimes better described as "juvenile," or, even "infantile," who have acted, in numerous instances, as mere lackeys of the U.S.-based, Bush-linked, International Republican Institute (IRI). The lunatic mismanagement of Russia's economy by such foreign-directed virtual "carpet-baggers," has been the most prominent political factor in shaping the disaster which has befallen Russia today.

			

				In all of this pattern, what is most notable, is the fact that the ruin of Russia's economy--including the ruin of its ability to pay foreign debts, or wages of domestic labor-force members and pensioners, has been a consistent expression of the inevitable result of a policy of "free trade" and "globalization," the self-same policy which has created the present world financial crisis, and which is collapsing and destroying the economies of the U.S.A., western Europe, and elsewhere.

			

				Russia has now made the first steps toward a major, long-needed correction in the relations of its own policy-making to the lunatic demands by the IMF and other agents of the G-7. The foreign resistance to Russia's recent actions, by these interests, is of two types.

			

				More simply, the first class of objection expresses the current mass insanity, otherwise called, more precisely, mass hysteria, expressed by influential circles in the U.S.A. and elsewhere, which are so far emotionally incapable of accepting the conclusive evidence, that their current, ideology-driven policies of "free trade" and "globalization" have been a colossal failure, both for the U.S.A. and most of the world besides.

			

				The second class of objection is typified by the depraved recent outburst of former U.S. Secretary of Defense (Sir) Caspar Weinberger, and others.[14] Weinberger's outburst was not only the mark of a mean-spirited, brutish, and wholly immoral man; like many of Weinberger's former fellow associates of Vice-President and President George Bush, it expressed the dropping of the mask, the coming to the surface of a long-standing, Hitler-like passion of mass-murderous hatred, which is typical of the current deployments of Bush's circles around the world today. This enmity was already the premise for the agreements among Thatcher, Mitterrand, and Bush, during the 1989-1992 period of Bush's term as President. These shameless monsters will oppose fanatically, any Russian government whose policies might prevent what Weinberger et al. so passionately desire, the obliteration of Russia, and virtually Russia's people, too.

			

				The consequence of a continued toleration of either of those two distinguishable kinds of lunatic reactions to Russia's change of policy-direction, would be to unleash a chain-reaction upon this planet, whose outcome must reduce the entire planet to the early eruption of a "New Dark Age," an eruption of "The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse," which would doom the entirety, or nearly the entirety, of this planet, most notably western Europe and the United States.

			
Principle 3: The United States, in a spirit of cooperation with China, Russia, and (hopefully) many other nations, including Japan and Germany, must establish a general program of cooperation for global development, a conception of the meaning of global development echoing the intention of U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt for the post-World War II world. The New Bretton Woods system whose emergence must accompany the implementation of such an emergency agreement on credit and trade, will emerge as a by-product of agreement to the intent of partnership based upon commitment to such emergency credit and trade agreements.

			

				The kind of agreement to be established must have an intended, initial duration of not less than ten years. The intent of the choice "ten years," is to convey the intent to reach a condition among the partners, under which a normal process of repayment of combined old and new forms of honorable debts may be confidently resumed. The point of immediate action, at which to begin the process leading toward such a happy escape from the present world crisis, would be the initiation of a Food for Peace program, initially focussed upon Russia, and designed according to the principles I have identified here.

			

				The agreement to be reached must not be approached with the idea of spelling all the terms of a "contract," before implementation begins. Rather, the first step is action, and then new action after that. Agreement to what becomes the needed New Bretton Woods order, will be built up as a by-product of preceding joint actions. Just as a war of independence has been frequently a necessary precondition for the establishment of a sovereign nation-state and its constitution, so most good things in human relations flow from a common participation in principled action; like a good sword forged in fire, the new institutions flow from such actions. (It may be said, that one of the leading problems of nations today, is that they have too many seasoned lawyers and lawyer-like politicians, and far too few actual revolutionaries.)

			

				This is not a pragmatic rule. It flows from an elementary consideration of principle.

			

				The cause of the self-induced catastrophes of nations, is rooted in the implied principles associated with habituated institutions and institutionalized practices. In such a circumstance, the idea of negotiating a codified international agreement, prior to implementing the measures which should be adopted, is a contradiction in terms, a fundamental error in principle.

			

				Here lies the root of the error in U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin's public endorsement of the recent G-7 statement. President Clinton could not wish to have a more loyal, intelligent, and capable administrator than Bob Rubin. However, Bob is not a revolutionary, but a master of the board-room and similar proceedings; he has not yet, at least, acquired the taste for making successful revolutions. What is required now, as a matter of principle, is a revolution.

			

				Bob Rubin, and people like him, should begin a crash program of strategic studies of the principle of the flank, beginning with the definitions of this principle by General William Tecumseh Sherman, the campaigns and doctrines of Lazare Carnot, the policies of Scharnhorst, and elaborated in the practice of the senior Helmut von Moltke, and by German Chief of Staff Alfred Graf von Schlieffen. The point? Buddy, we are at war in a certain form of expression, and we must think like the greatest commanders in war in approaching the choices of strategy and tactics for this occasion.

			

				War, in its most general expression, that is, with or without actual war-fighting, is the imposition of a principle by force of action. One does not establish the principle before the action, but as a consequence of it. The characteristic of such warfare, is the principle of action demonstrated at Arbela, by Alexander the Great, and by Sherman's tour-de-force in flanking, in his march through Alabama and Georgia, the action of a "hammer," which pulverized the enemy on Grant's anvil.

			

				In republican forms of warfare, as typified by the international practice in leadership of Benjamin Franklin, the principle is to choose those opportunities of terrain and situation presented, by means of which to outwit the enemy, exploiting, as Sherman stressed, some relevant defect of the enemy's blockheaded mind, as Frederick the Great did to a vastly superior Austrian force at Leuthen, and as the Confederate commanders were defeated by Sherman because they were his intellectual inferiors. That battle of the minds, is warfare at its best, least bloody, and most noble, as General MacArthur demonstrated this most excellently in his Pacific command, where he was obliged to defeat not only Japan's commanders, but also the Pacific policy of Winston Churchill, and a certain high-ranking faction of those in the Navy who mistook unnecessary battles, and casualties caused and incurred as bloody military glory.

			

				Who is the enemy? Well, Sir Caspar Weinberger, for one. As European civilization emerged from the downfall of feudal traditions, from about 1714's accession of George I to the newly created throne of the United Kingdom, until the present day, the principal strategic conflict on this planet has been between two versions of capitalism, the one typified by the American System of political-economy, and the other, the chief opponent of the American System, the British monarchy. In this long struggle for survival of what was wrought in Benjamin Franklin's Philadelphia, the U.S. patriot has been beset not only by foreign adversaries, but also by those influential portions of our own population, who have consented to be agents of influence of the British monarchy, as exemplified by the case of Sir Caspar Weinberger.

			

				In this continuing global struggle between the two most powerful economic models of today's world--the American versus the British model--the gravest threat to the U.S.A. itself, has been the British reliance upon corrupting the U.S.A. through the influence of "free trade" and related policies. For systemic philosophical reasons inhering implicitly in the doctrine of "free trade," the United States could not continue to survive but for recurrence of those periods, including the Civil War, in which the corrosive influence of "free trade" was defeated and the American tradition of Franklin, Hamilton, the Careys, and List re-established. The most recent return to American principles, was under the leadership of Franklin Roosevelt as President.

			

				The entirety of the present world-wide financial and economic crisis, and most of the political conflicts among nations today, are a reflection of the efforts, by London and fellow-travellers such as Sir Henry Kissinger and Sir Caspar "Cap the Knife" Weinberger, to impose London-concocted "free trade" and "globalization" policies upon the U.S.A., China, Malaysia, Russia, and the states of Central and South America. Thus, our U.S. strategy must never be degraded to the brutish sport of the professional football field or the Roman imperial arena. We fight for principle, and we select opportunities for action, especially preferring flanking actions, in which the relative strength of an emerging community of principle is developed. We must put aside the infantile, macho's delusion, that it is the governments of nations which are our allies, and recognize, instead, that it is principles which must be the basis for our policy, our strategy.

			

				When possible, attack by surprise. When possible, attack the flank, preferably with emphasis upon the psychological flank. Let these flanking actions be pre-emptive actions, not mass-masturbatory exercises in diplomacy, as by Sir Henry Kissinger at al. The Old Regime has failed. In its moment of weakness, we must make a revolution, in this case the re-enactment of the American Revolution, as by such exemplars as Franklin, Washington, John Quincy Adams, Abraham Lincoln, and Franklin Roosevelt. The United States is still a great power, with powerful friends. Don't lead our forces into the swamp of G-7 lunacies; take pre-emptive action, often ad hoc, with appropriate partners. Establish the principle on which the New Bretton Woods will be based, before marching onto the diplomatic battlefield, in search of agreements with regimes which are already doomed. Robert Rubin must learn--quickly--to think as a revolutionary, to think as a soldier drafted from civilian life in the mummy room of the boardroom museums, to fight as a soldier.

			

				Naturally, the mummies, being mummies, keep jabbering about an expected early recovery.

[2] To fill out the relevant roster of geek acts featured in the same carnival of depravities, that Morris is, notably, the cousin of the late and notorious Roy M. Cohn, and was raised in Cohn's household. Cohn was the former, Lucianne Goldberg-linked "mouthpiece" for the families of some of President Clinton's nastiest well-connected, extreme right-wing Zionist, and other Starr-crossed adversaries from today's and yesterday's New York. The same Morris is a common link of "Third Way" types among Germany, the U.S.A., and Israel. Morris's attempt to set up the President in the matter of the grand jury testimony demanded by Starr, punctuates the connections with provocative question-marks; there are too many connections to be overlooked.

			
[3] "Natural scale," means the scale as determined by the natural characteristics of both the human singing voice and, also, the characteristics of musical hearing. The scales which might be attributed to inorganic objects, as the hoaxsters Helmholtz and Ellis did, such as metal pipes, whistles, and what not, pertain not to music, but to clatter. As demonstrated by this reporter's associates, the natural, well-tempered scale of J.S. Bach, is readily and conclusively reconstructed, as a well-tempered scale at C=256, by studying Bach's choral polyphony, with an eye to the range of typical well-trained chorus voices, and with regard to the function of the register-shifts within the compositional process represented. Ellis's contrary conclusions, like the counterfeit doctrine of Claudius Ptolemy earlier, are demonstrated by such physical evidence, to have been a plain, willful fraud, concocted with malicious intent.

			
[4] Former Amadeus Quartet Primarius Norbert Brainin has identified the notion of Motivführung with the new method of composing a movement of a string quartet, as seen in Haydn's Opus 33 ("Russian") string quartets. Mozart references Haydn's precedence on this account in his own "Haydn quartets," but also introduces a new principle of motivic thorough-composition, derived from the studies of, most notably, Bach's A Musical Offering. When the latter Bach work is reexamined in the light of Bach's The Art of the Fugue, the genius leading from Bach and Mozart, into Beethoven's late string quartets, the method of Bachian motivic thorough-composition, becomes more transparent. The direct connection between Beethoven's revolutionary Seventh Symphony, and Brahms' further development of the new principle in Beethoven's Seventh, in Brahms' own Fourth Symphony, then becomes the most exciting, and powerful idea known in music to date. On this account, the recorded direction of Schubert's Ninth Symphony and Brahms' Fourth, by Wilhelm Furtwängler, are among the greatest legacies in known performance-history available today. See "The Case of Classical Motivic Thorough-Composition," Executive Intelligence Review, Sept. 4, 1998.

[7] We are taking a short-cut here, merely to identify, as briefly as possible, a point of crucial relevance to the subject of the implications of the developed human individual's cognitive action in determining the physical characteristics of economic processes. In the development of those conceptions upon which modern European civilization's revolution in economy depended, we are touching upon a notion of harmonic coherence, as it occurs in musical composition, in relation to the notion of harmony which is central to notions of trajectories of development of physical processes in general. The outstanding points of reference are the treatment of this by Plato, Kepler, Leibniz, and Gauss. In respect to motivic thorough-composition, this notion of harmonic coherence not only occurs in musical composition; this notion of Classical principles, as derived from the adducible characteristics of Classical Greek, is the "Classical idea," which shaped the use of Classical Greek models, from St. Augustine on, especially from Dante Alighieri and Petrarch on, in defining the principles of modern Classical artistic composition. The notion that any Classical composition, whether in music, poetry, drama, or plastic art-forms, must be purified to such a degree that any entire composition represents but one permeating idea of development throughout, is the conscience of all successful modern Classical artists. In known history, this conception was first elaborated by Plato, and is the explicitly Platonic conception underlying the entirety of the mathematical physics developed by Kepler, through his The New Astronomy. In physics, it is the notion of the non-linear characteristic of orbital systems central to the work of Kepler and of Gauss's and Riemann's entire development of his notion of multiply-connected manifolds. On Gauss's method, see Jonathan Tennenbaum and Bruce Director, "How Gauss Determined the Orbit of Ceres," Fidelio, Summer 1998. This notion of motivic thorough-composition expresses, in musical form, the principle of action characteristic of the notion of a simultaneity of eternity: in each moment of such a composition, the past and future are efficiently coexistent. Herein lies, precisely, the moral, and scientific contribution of Classical motivic thorough-composition, the secret of the unexcelled importance of this development out of the germ provided by J.S. Bach. This is truly religious music, as nothing can compete with it on this account.

			
[8] Among the best pedagogical examples of this problem in performance, is the challenge of conducting the second movement of Franz Schubert's Ninth Symphony. One must grasp the principle emphasized by Pablo Casals, that there is no simple strophic repetition in the performance of a great composer's composition, but, in Casals' words, "always variation." An excellent example of this principle, comparable to the Schubert movement referenced, is Friedrich Schiller's poem Die Glocke. Compare the sometimes brilliant musical apprehension of this Schiller poem by Romberg. View this connection in light of Schubert's explicit adoption of Schiller's argument, against Goethe and Reichardt, on the musical perfection of a Classical poem. See also Jenner on Brahms' instruction on musical perfection of poetry, as cited in A Manual on the Rudiments of Tuning and Registration, op. cit. Excellent examples of the role of brief intervals within a composition, in defining the characteristic of the composition as a whole, include the challenge of shaping the opening interval of Beethoven's Eroica with the proper differentiation of the conductor's choice of attack, and similar problems of conducting posed by the opening attack required by the Scherzo and Finale of Schubert's Ninth. Furtwängler's approach to these challenges of the Eroica and Schubert's Ninth, is of exemplary excellence on this point. If, in such instances, the approach chosen for the attack, fails to shape the opening interval appropriately, the entirety of the subsequent performance of that movement will not achieve the coherence intended by the composer.

			
[9] We shall examine, in my closing rebuttal of Secretary Bob Rubin's blunder of assumption, in defending the G-7 package, how precisely such problems of failing to correlate technical details with the relevant cultural principle, can have devastating results.

			
[10] Contrary to the purely mythical pretense, concocted by Venice's Paris-based Abbot Antonio Conti, the leading Leibniz-hater of the late Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries, Isaac Newton never developed a calculus, before, simultaneously with, or after Leibniz had issued his report of the discovery, in Paris, in 1676. Simply, Newton's work never contained an actual calculus. The modern form of the so-called "Leibniz-Newton" controversy, is the result of Augustin Cauchy's "limit theorem" hoax, in which Cauchy purported to show that a bowdlerized version of Leibniz's calculus would work very well, by eliminating the most crucial, Keplerian feature of Leibniz's calculus, that the derivative corresponds to a non-constant (non-linear) curvature in the infinitesimally small. Leibniz's principle, is the cornerstone of the development of the principles of hypergeometry (multiply-connected manifolds) by Gauss and Riemann.

Weinberger's statements are in contrast with his writings in Forbes magazine shortly after he left the Reagan administration, when he had the perspective that Russia's infrastructure and industry should be developed.

			I love your organization. I am striving fir it but it will take me awhile! 

Smiles, cyndi      
			You do such lovely displays! I love the hammer door knob! 

All your displays are beautiful and you have great stuff! 

Smiles, cyndi      
			I love this, so beautiful! 

I have some fan blades to make dragonflies with, I do have plenty so maybe here is another use. 
I just love her! 

Our scarecrow is just so traditional, a pole in overalls and hat holding a flower pot.

			So creative Lauretta, 

This is fabulous! 

Smiles, Cyndi      
			Oh My!  I collect magazines from the thrifts and am looking to make some jewelry! 

Thanks for this fabulous idea! I saw some Christmas china n a Dillards' ad that would be awesome, so the newspaper is a good source also. 

I am getting my scissors, Smiles, Cyndi      
			How cute and easy to do with whatever junk I have collected!

Super idea for the holidays!

Smiles, Cyndi      
			This is fabulous! The whole corner is awesome! 

I am going to paper wrap some branches also, thanks for the idea! 

Smiles, Cyndi      
			Refreshing idea! 

I have to find an old chair now! 

Smiles, Cyndi      
			What a fabulous idea! 

I am lovin' it! 

Smiles, Cyndi      
			Many thanks for all your comments!
 It was fun making them just deciding what to do with what as I went. No detailed plans and make it as we go and my husband had to tell me when to stop! 
Smiles, Cyndi

			I am having trouble resizing to be acceptable. I have uploaded in the past and had trouble. I don't understand the image pixals and mb, I tried with my kodak easyshare sizes and under custom I need the numbers to put in. 
I do have picasa with my flicker account. I will try there. 

Thanks for all the advice, Smiles, cyndi      
			I adore this idea, I got started working on one too! I have the globe on a lamp base that needed a unique shade and this is perfect. I am just trying to decide the trim to use. I have three or four to choose from and it is so hard to make a decision.

I got a vintage suitcase filled with trims and seam bindings, What a great find it was! 


I adore your necklace idea, I came back to see what you used! 
Thanks and Smiles, Cyndi



			I have been using the discarded light fixtures I find at the thrift store for the same thing, A candle and poupourri, or with acorns and pine cones, BUT, I never thought to add a chain to hang them! Great idea to use the battery LED candle also.

Thanks, I will use this idea in my new consignment booth! I filled and beveled glass one with gold and white balls, (large size) and someone bought all the the balls from it.  
I also had some of the balls on a brass stand and they left them alone. (Grins) 

Oh well, Let's think what else we can use these for? Oh, I also used them in my photo here I sent in regarding cloches. They are great for a vintage look setting! 

Many thanks for sharing your display and idea.
Smiles, Cyndi      
			I have a globe in my garage without a bottom holder, What a fine idea! Smiles, Cyndi      
			What a fun booth, many thanks for sharing the photos! Clocks are always fun, you do have a few to choose from! Great show! 

Smiles, cyndi      
			Thanks for telling and showing us the hay unloader, a mininature?, well I wish I was a farm girl!  I adore your jewelry tree and assortment of Merry christmas letters, your clock box filled with a white coat Santa and goodies, snow people, jars and trees! The pine cone tree is awesome too with the tubes! 

Smiles, Cyndi      
			You did a fabulous job with the pennants, I adore the tree topper and that great petal car! Hang on to all of it! Smiles, Cyndi      
			You did a fabulous job, their is always another way to display than the obvious, that is part of the fun of junking(or not-junking) Let's say, re-purposing! 

smiles, cyndi      
			Sorry I missed you chat but I will go fan Gorilla Glue Now! 

Smiles, cyndi      
			I better go look through my box of metals to paint, Hey, you  have given me a new idea if any match. Thanks Sue! 

Smiles, Cyndi      
			I was there also! I met Sue and got her two books signed and met the Junk Gypsies also. I never would have thought of an old Post Office box but BRILLIANT Idea! 

And the idea is so fitting for the occasion too. I hope to be back spring 2010 also.

Smiles, cyndi      
			What a fabulous idea you have come up with. Be Proud! 

Smiles, Cyndi      
			You have done a fabulous job re-doing this! Looks Awesome!

Smiles, Cyndi      
			Great idea for the spring and of course it is awesome. I just pulled some springs myself, what a fabulous idea! Smiles, Cyndi      
			They are awesome and you have a great assortment of metal wings! smiles, Cyndi      
			I love it, Great idea for ALICE! 

Smiles, Cyndi      
			You do have  fabulous booth. This is my dream to be doing something like you are. Great Going! 

Smiles, Cyndi      
			I do really love this! And Tom Jones! 

It does fit the song well, oh the 60's memories of him with my girlfriend.  You did a fabulous job!

Smiles, cyndi      
			That is one awesoem cart your found. I love the size and you made it fabulous with Fall decorations, I am sure it will be beautiful ALL year! 

Smiles, Cyndi      
			It is absolutely beautiful Lanette! I am also so thankful to you for explaining what the items were in a past life as I am still learning farm equipment. But, what an awesome door decoration you created! 
I love cedar greens and need to go wander myself. 

Smiles, Cyndi


			What a fabulous looking booth shop! Oh, How I wish I was there too. I love all the ideas you are sharing! It is such a fun atmosphere!  SMiles, Cyndi      
			Opps, that is 12 inches for the Expressions! I have a cat on my lap, sorry for that mistake....

Smiles, Cyndi and purrrrrs from Blck      
			Well, I better unpack mine.I have a cricut and should have got the expressions, if you get one ,it cuts up to 12' instead of the 6 inches I got. Well, like I say itis still in the box. I need to make time to play as I  l love words also. I got a bunch of cartridges with lots of cutouts to learn about. 

Smjiles, Cyndi      
			Another fun piece from this and that put together for a fabulous new trio of elements! Smiles, Cyndi      
			I Love seeoing the great junk finds and hard to call them junk they are so awesome. I sure do miss being in Warrenton this fall, but I was there last spring. I still WISH I was there! 

Great going, Awesome to have a store to shop for! 

Smiles, Cyndi      
			I have the rusty crusty bed springs in my etsy shop, Just need to find a bell ringer,thinking if what I can sub for it.

Smiles, Cyndi

http://ByLightOfMoon.etsy.com      
			I am like you when you started , I have a binful of china to break up and use, but have not started it yet.

Your projects are awesome. I would say you are a master at it and can do whatever your desire. Of course, I adore the dragonfly as that is ME!  Your tables and cabinet are wonderful. Thanks for the idea of the beach ball. And I have a bowling ball just sitting in my garden waiting to get done.

Many thanks for the ideas and prodge to get me going! 

SMiles, Cyndi      
			You have Great Junk! I love the antique Ice bucket also, What fun can be made with that?  Keep it up and thanks for sharing!

I have a garage full of stuff! I need to sell it or use it to make room! 

Smiles, Cyndi      
			I love these ideas! FabulOus! 

Smiles, Cyndi      
			What a lovely idea for the Holiday! Beautiful; photos and a fabulous idea with the bag, Smiles, Cyndi      
			What a fabulous idea to do with a bedspring! I collect them too! 

smiles, Cyndi      
			Okey, I am looking for a crate! We have many casters on hand from trying to keep our ottoman rolling and moveable! Great Idea for the Daisies, they are one of my favorite flowers and I DO collect bottles; beer, soda, wine, olive oil, any kind! 

It would also be a nice way to root my chocolate and peppermint
I grow, Just pluck off a leaf for your mojoto, or tea and when it roots,you have plants for more, they duplicate all over very fast, so be ready to share it with your friends! 

Smiles,Cyndi      
			This is really a fabulous idea, who'da thought? I will have to look for the metal more when I am out and about. I like the universal ideas of salads and candy, how about a jewelry display in the bowls and keep the tuba flowers vase always in anything? How about maybe even a lace and ribbon organizer also? Let's keep thinking! 

smiles, Cyndi      
			These are Awesome Ideas Candy, Who'da thought? 

I have that lampshade in the garage, going to work! But no piano rolls, I wish! I will find something!

Smiles, Cyndi      
			I have several sets of dominos that are new. Do you know how to grunge them to look old and used? 

I also have some black dominos from an estate sale that are souvineer "Washington Capitol" dominos. Any ideas?, The color bleeds also. 

Many thanks, Cyndi      
			Sue, 

Your inventive ways never cease to amaze. I wish I lived closer to all these chickie items you use! I know I need to do more outdoor flea markets. IT was an honor to have met you in Texas and I don't call that a flea Market! WOW! 

Your descriptions are over the top! I am in desperate need of room. I thik I need a barn to work in. But, my little workrooms are full and I need these space organizers more than you ever know! 

Thanks for all the inspirations and ideas you share. I did have a ton of clear plastic shoe boxes. and I shall now open up my decorative tins to USE THEM! 
Smiles, Cyndi      
			Thanks Sue for the autographed Books at Marburger Farms last week at Spring Week in Texas. Iknow I will be sing a third soon and after this a series will follow. I know this as you are so talented with ideas.

I will be tuned in on Monday and starting my re-organization with reduce, reuse,recycle and upcycle using some of your ideas! 

smiles, cyndi/frstyfrolk      
			I just adore the sites you have to stop, trun around and go back too! 

Smiles,cyndi      
			I love your green table with the pottery! Great Look, 
smiles, cyndi      
			Lovin'It! 

Smiles,cyndi      
			Now, see I am learning, in the past I would have just hung on my backyard fence. Now, to make a lamp or whatever, great ideas, I am opening my eyes and ears! smiles, cyndi      
			Awesome idea, I had done a photo frame with wearring at a consignmnet booth, but everyone has more than that will hold. I adore this! 

smiles, cyndi      
			Awesome, I would love to see your crazy quilt.

smiles, cyndi

Copyright 
© Svipja Techno Consultants Pvt Ltd. All Rights Reserved.March 5, 2002Dear GENI Friend,Many years ago, I was meeting with the President 
                            of a large windpower 
                            company and he used the phrase power 
                            purchase agreement. Little did I understand 
                            how critical this is in the development of this industry. 
                            At another conference, two leaders in the field suggested 
                            that government buy-downs 
                            would help accelerate the renewable energy development.Large energy development is one of the most capital-intensive 
                            industries, requiring major investments with multi-year 
                            payback periods. It is usually the domain of global 
                            energy giants, Wall Street and the international development 
                            banks. However, governments can play a vital role 
                            by offering tax credits and become the initial customers 
                            of the new technology.For example, we now all benefit from the Internet. 
                            Twenty years ago, it's origins were born from the 
                            U.S. DARPA(Defense 
                            Advanced Research Procurement Agency), which wanted 
                            an electronic communications system for the government 
                            in case of war. Then, universities became involved 
                            to facilitate research exchange between energy and 
                            weapons laboratories. This early file transfer protocol 
                            gave birth to the widespread public use of the Internet. 
                            But, the first customer was the United States government.Governments act on our behalf, working for the common 
                            good. They can contract for services in new industries, 
                            providing a kickstart to more desirable infrastructure. 
                            Federal, state and local governments have the ability 
                            to make large purchase commitments  and thus 
                            help drive down costs as manufacturing scales up. 
                            Then you see the entrepreneurs jump in.  We invite 
                            you  to encourage your government officials to 
                            make a strong commitment to renewable 
                            energy (Pg. 3, Figure 6-1). Ask them to support tax incentives for 
                            renewable energy development, and suggest that they 
                            write power purchase agreements with competing wind, 
                            solar, geothermal and biomass developers. This 
                            will accelerate what we all want  a more sustainable 
                            future for all.In partnership for the planetPeter Meisen

The ERV heat exchanger not only transfers this heat, but transfers some of the moisture in the more humid exhaust air into the less humid supply air. This heat/energy transfer means that your home heating system uses less when compared to any other form of ventilation.
      
      During the cooling seasons the process depends whether or not you are exhausting air conditioned air. If you are not air conditioning the indoor air, ventilation is generally accomplished by opening windows and turning off the air exchanger.If you are air conditioning the indoor air, heat is transferred from the warm/hot outdoor supply air into the cool indoor exhaust air inside the HRV heat exchanger, thus reducing the temperature of the fresh air coming in. The ERV heat exchanger not only transfers this heat but transfers some of the moisture in the more humid supply air into the less humid exhaust air, thus reducing the humidity of the fresh air coming in. This heat/energy transfer means that your house cooling system uses less energy when compared to any other form of ventilation. This transfer of heat or energy is accomplished with very little or no mixing of the 2 air streams, meaning the pollutants are exhausted and the heat/energy is recovered.

When many people think about saving for retirement they think it is too complicated.  It can be, but most of the time people are over-thinking it.  Saving for retirement doesn't have to be hard, it doesn't have to take a lot of time, and ideally you shouldn't have to think about it much.  There are plenty of ways to make saving for your retirement easy.Setting up retirement accounts might take some work initially, but once they are up and running it should take very little of your time or mental energy.  This makes it very easy in the long run!  You don't need some fancy financial planner and you don't need to micromanage your account and make a lot of changes.  Just set up something simple like a ROTH IRA or a Money Market Account and make the deposits automatic.  Look at your year end statement and determine if your retirement account is still meeting your needs and make adjustments at that time.  When it comes time to retire you will thank your younger self.by Robin Olsen4by Veronica13by Chris Mills21by Mark Shulkosky2by Sally Hayes2by Cruncher3by Mazlan11by Lela16Sign in or sign up and post using a HubPages Network account.No HTML is allowed in comments, but URLs will be hyperlinked.

Islamic industries are expanding globally and governments are taking notice of a sector that could be worth trillions.When Kerim Ture placed his first order for a batch of long-sleeved tunics that could be worn by Muslim women, the manufacturers producing them demanded payment upfront, apparently convinced the venture would fail and Ture would be left unable to pay them.The Turkish entrepreneur quickly proved that their scepticism was unfounded, and he was back shortly afterwards to place a new order, having sold the first.Â Today the website Ture established to sell his products, Modanisa, attracts 100 million visitors annually, has customers in 120 countries, and has no shortage of manufacturers willing to work with it.Â "Modanisa now has 300 suppliers and 30 designers, it's become a platform for hundreds of suppliers from all over the world who want to sell products on our site," a spokesperson for the company told Al Jazeera.However, Ture's story is not simply about one company's success and his own financial achievements.In establishing Modanisa in 2011, Ture wanted to offer Muslim women who chose to adopt "modest" Islamic dress codes, more options than were then available and give them an outlet they had lacked."Just because they (Muslim women) wanted to cover a little more, the world ignored them and they had to suffer with the same old boring clothes," Ture told the audience at a TEDx talk in Bulgaria in May, adding: "We thought it was unfair."Clothing is more than a fabric you put on your body, it's more than that, it's part of your expression and part of your identity, it's unfair."Modanisa is one small part of the diverse and expanding 'halal' sector, which according to research by the Thomson Reuters foundation is estimated to be worth $3.7 trillion by 2019.As 'halal' simply means 'permissible' in the Arabic language, the term can be applied to any product or service, which does not violate Islamic laws and social norms.What separates halal industries from others, which do not necessarily fall foul of Islamic injunctions, is aÂ conscious effort to accommodate the requirements of Muslim consumers.The industries involved are as varied as banks offering services that avoid the accrual of interest and nail varnishÂ that allows a user to perform ablution before prayer.Other major industries include the halal food sector, clothing, and tourism.The trend is particularly noticeable among Muslim communities in western countries, such as the UK, where international brands such as KFC and Subway offer halal menus, clothes shops such as H&M and Marks and Spencer sell clothing lines geared towards Muslim women, supermarkets have halal food sections, and mainstream banks offer Islamic finance products. Â Cardiff University's Dr Jamal Ahmed explained that consumption of 'halal' products was driven just as much by issues of identity as commitment to Islamic rules.Â Jamal Ahmed, Cardiff University"Academic studies have consistently reported that ethnic minorities in general but Muslims in particular, feel more strongly about their identities than people back home (their countries of origin)," Ahmed said."Accordingly, Muslims seek identity anchors when they construct their notions of self and make a statement about who they are."Consuming halal, be it food, clothing, travel or Islamic finance, gives them a sense of identity but also a sense of stability and freedom from anxieties."However, where an individual consumer sees the fulfilment of a religious obligation or act affirming their identity, governments see fiscal growth potential.Recent exhibitions of halal businesses in Japan and Turkey drew backing from the governments of those countries.In 2013, former British Prime Minister David Cameron declared his intent to make London "one of the great capitals of Islamic finance", and announced the issue of the UK's first government bond compliant with Islamic law, becoming the first non-Muslim state to do so.It's not just in the financial industry that countries that are not majority-Muslim are taking a lead role in the growth of the halal sector.Brazil's Muslims make up a tiny part of its population of 207 million people, at just over 200,000, yet the country is a leading exporter of halal beef, with the industry valued at close to $6bn in 2015.Similarly, New Zealand is also a leading exporter of halal meat despite its relatively small Muslim population, with sales of $576m.Abdul Azim Ahmed, a researcher in Contemporary Religion, told Al Jazeera that while the growth in the halal sector gave accessible alternatives to the Muslim population, there was also a danger of "simply reducing Muslim ethics down to consumer choice".Â Abdul Azim Ahmed, Researcher in Contemporary IslamAhmed explained that placing too much emphasis on the consumer end of halal produce, took the focus away from the wider issue of whether aspects such as the manufacturing processes or treatment of workers complied with Islamic ethics."The greater accessibility of halal meat is certainly a good thing in democratising food, there is still however a question to whether or not industrial scale slaughter of animals meets the spirit of Islamic ethics.""Another example, the Nike 'Pro-Hijab' was chosen as one of 2017's top inventions by Time Magazine. The Nike Pro Hijab had negible impact on the lives of Muslim women, and with allegations of abusive work practices still surrounding its many factories, it is right to ask how 'Islamically' ethical are the products being pitched at Muslims."I believe a truly Islamic approach to business, manufacturing, and conservation requires a fundamentally more radical approach involving governments and transnational organisations, and that it will not be achieved by a shift in consumer practice."

            SOURCE: Al Jazeera NewsSince March 2015, Saudi Arabia and a coalition of Arab states have launched more than 19,278 air raids across Yemen.Many Pentecostal churches in the Niger Delta offer to deliver people from witchcraft and possession - albeit for a fee.No, it wasn't because of WMDs, democracy or Iraqi oil. The real reason is much more sinister than that.

	 AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementDuurzame energie. Is dat niet iets wat we allemaal willen? We schrijven dit in visiedocumenten en bedrijfsfilosofieën en het is niet meer weg te denken uit de samenleving. Het doel is zelfs om in 2050 landelijk energieneutraal zijn. In de uitvoeringsagenda van ons dorp las ik dat dit al meteen kan, want de techniek is voorhanden en er is voldoende ruimte. Als we in ons dorp ongeveer 25 windmolens plaatsen, 10% van de oppervlakte uitrusten met zonnepanelen en een paar flinke vergisters vergunnen, dan is het klusje geklaard. De 4 nadelen

Maar, zo eenvoudig is dat niet. Het belangrijkste probleem is het netwerk dat een vertakking vanaf de centrale naar de eindgebruikers kent. Als die eindgebruikers centrales worden, dan zijn de aftakkingen niet geschikt voor de omgekeerde route. Een tweede nadeel is dat energiestromen niet geleidelijk vrijkomen, maar nadrukkelijke pieken kennen.Er is nog een derde probleem, en dat is dat deze installaties ook overlast veroorzaken. Dit omdat het zicht op de installaties niet als prettig wordt ervaren en er verschillende ongewenste bijeffecten zijn: spiegeling, geur schaduw en/of geluid. Het vierde en laatste probleem is dat veel van de technieken op zichzelf niet rendabel zijn. Er is dus subsidie nodig en die is er ook niet oneindig.In het afgelopen jaar is, ondanks de bovenstaande nadelen, het aandeel duurzame energie in Nederland toegenomen van 6,6% in 2017 naar 7,3% in 2018. Om in 2023 op koers te zitten, moet 16% van de energie afkomstig zijn uit hernieuwbare bronnen. Naarmate het aandeel duurzame energie stijgt, neemt echter ook de zwaarte van de nadelen toe.Accu's bieden een oplossing voor veel van deze problemen, maar zijn nog niet helemaal uitontwikkeld. Bij TNO staat al een praktijkoplossing in de stijgers voor woonhuizen. En bij een project in het noorden van het land wordt zelfs een veebedrijf uitgerust met accu’s, die voldoende groot zijn om alle benodigde energie voor dat bedrijf vrij te geven. Kortom: waar een wil is, is een weg. Energiebesparing

Volgens mij moeten we sterk inzetten op energiebesparing, waardoor we ongeveer de helft van de problemen al kunnen tackelen. Gedurende mijn bezoeken voor 'energiescans' zie ik dat er geweldige kansen zijn om iets aan energiebesparing te doen. Waar veehouders werken aan plannen om met een investering van €100.000 een rendement van 5% (oftewel €5.000 per jaar) te realiseren, kom ik na een paar bezoekjes met gemak op een jaarlijkse besparing die het dubbele bedraagt.Soms is er inderdaad een investering voor nodig, maar dat bedrag is vaak niet van meer dan €10.000. De terugverdientijden variëren daarmee van 0 tot 5 jaar. Pas wanneer deze mogelijkheden uitgeput zijn, denken we over andere zaken (zoals zonnepanelen, warmtepompen en biomassaketels). Ook interessant, maar pas van latere orde. Productieproblemen

Soms bestaat de vrees dat het besparen op het energieverbruik leidt tot productieproblemen. Deze vrees is deels terecht, want we zoeken immers de grens op. Echter, ik durf te stellen dat er evenveel problemen zijn door onnodig extra verbruik: denk aan oplopende weerstanden, waardoor ook tocht, lekkage en slijtage in de hand gewerkt worden.Je moet ook denken aan warmte die vrijkomt op een plaats waar dat niet gewenst is, zoals het kraamhok. De zeug functioneert het beste bij 16 graden Celsius, de biggen bij 30 graden Celsius. Regelmatig kom ik zeugen tegen die warmer liggen dan de biggen. Aangezien warmte die gemiddeld vrijkomt uit een vleesvarkensbedrijf voldoende is om 5 andere bedrijven van gelijke omvang te voorzien, wordt er weinig gas verbruikt.Het lukt mij op deze bedrijven dan wel om een flinke elektrabesparing te adviseren. Aangezien je hier bij varkensbedrijven al snel bij de ventilatie uitkomt, is het wel noodzakelijk dat je als adviseur goed op de hoogte bent van de klimaatzaken. Overheid grijpt in

De overheid grijpt ook in om bedrijven meer energie te laten besparen. Vanaf 1 juli 2019 moeten bedrijven die meer dan 50.000 kWh verbruiken verplicht een energiescan laten doen. Hierin staat onder meer welke besparingsmogelijkheden het bedrijf heeft en wanneer deze gerealiseerd kunnen worden. Enerzijds is dit jammer, omdat hierdoor de motivatie die nodig is om er echt iets aan te doen, ontbreekt. Anderzijds zullen een aantal bedrijven van deze nood een deugd maken en het ombuigen in een voordeel.Daarentegen zullen er ook bedrijven zijn die al zuinig werken, waardoor er nog maar weinig te besparen valt. Daarnaast zijn er bedrijven waar juist veel te besparen valt, maar waar het vermogen ontbreekt om de benodigde investering te doen. Ook hier zijn mooie oplossingen voor te bedenken. Vermogen komt immers al lang niet altijd meer van de bank; zeker als het gaat om rendabele duurzaamheidsinvesteringen. Kortom: heel veel neuzen staan al de goede kant op als het gaat om de duurzaamheidsgedachte.© DCA MultiMedia. Op deze marktinformatie berust auteursrecht.

The capstone of this specialization is designed with the goal of allowing you to experience this process. The capstone project will take you from data to analysis and models, and ultimately to presentation of insights. 

In this capstone project, you will analyze the data on financial loans to help with the investment decisions of an investment company. You will go through all typical steps of a data analytics project, including data understanding and cleanup, data analysis, and presentation of analytical results. 
For the first week, the goal is to understand the data and prepare the data for analysis. As we discussed  in this specialization, data preprocessing and cleanup is often the first step in data analytics projects. Needless to say, this step is crucial for the success of this project.  

In the second week, you will perform some predictive analytics tasks, including classifying loans and predicting losses from defaulted loans. You will try a variety of tools and techniques  this week, as the predictive accuracy of different tools can vary quite a bit. It is rarely the case that the default model produced by ASP is the best model possible. Therefore, it is important for you to tune the different models in order to improve the performance.

Beginning in the third week, we turn our attention to prescriptive analytics, where you will provide some concrete suggestions on how to allocate investment funds using analytics tools, including clustering and simulation based optimization. You will see that allocating funds wisely is crucial for the financial return of the investment portfolio.

In the last week, you are expected to present your analytics results to your clients. Since you will obtain many results in your project, it is important for you to judiciously choose what to include in your presentation. You are also expected to follow the principles we covered in the courses in preparing your presentation.HauptmenÃ¼:2012N4ALrobWªÆ©uhÅubcR[vðèoµÜµ½B»ÌbcR[ÍAgNziÁèÛpHij¤iÅA­Jn¼ã©çålCÆÈèA­QTÔÅNÔÚWÅ Á½100P[XðB¬µA2012N9ÉÍÌÚWðÌV{ÆÈé700P[XÉø«ã°Üµ½BX|T[h N

CorporationSuggested Keywords: Account types, DRIPs, Routing number, IP, Penny stocksSuggested Keywords: Account types, DRIPs, Routing number, IP, Penny stocksMike Loewengart, Vice President of Investment StrategyE*TRADE Capital Management2018 marked a turning point in the financial markets, punctuated by volatility, trade wars, rising interest rates, and a shifting political dyanmic.So, what does the new year hold in store? Here are five themes to follow in 2019:While most of the worldâs economies are expanding and the economic outlook is generally sound, there remain obstacles to growth in 2019.Trade wars: Over the past year, the Trump administration has slapped more than $250 billion in tariffs on China alone, but the administration has also targeted steel, aluminum, solar panels and appliances imported from other countries.1 Who is winning the trade war? Many economists would say no one, since tariffs increase the price of imports and can be an impediment to economic growth.Budget deficits: Tax cuts enacted in 2017, coupled with increased military spending, have ballooned the federal budget deficit, which could surpass $1 trillion in 2019. Budget deficits can cause interest rates to rise, because higher yields are needed to attract creditors. Higher interest rates could, in turn, impede economic growth.Brexit: The UK is slated to leave the European Union in 2019, but the exit terms are still murky. The 2016 Brexit vote has already been a stumbling block to growth in the UK, and a formal exit from the trading bloc could materially affect growth as well.Bottom line: While decelerating economic growth doesnât bode well for the markets as a whole, high-quality bonds, overlooked value stocks, and more defensive sectors could benefit.Novemberâs midterm elections resulted in a divided government, with Democrats regaining control of the House of Representatives and Republicans expanding their hold on the Senate. A divided government can result in gridlock at the Capitol, slowing the pace of legislation.While this may frustrate voters, fewer potential bills could be a salve to investors, who would have less legislative uncertainty to navigate. Moreover, the US economy has expanded during periods of divided government beforeâincluding during the early stretches of the most recent bull market.Bottom line: Divided government could provide a tailwind to the markets.The Federal Reserve has lifted short-term interest rates three times this year but has hinted at slowing the pace of monetary tightening as rates move closer to neutral.Inflation: Consumer price inflation hasnât risen significantly of late, but it is running at the Fedâs target rate of 2%. Until inflation moves lower, the Fed could continue to raise rates.Unemployment: The US unemployment rate dipped to 3.5% in the third quarter and has remained close to that figure since. With unemployment at a 49-year low, additional gains in an already-tight labor market seem unlikely. Given stiff competition for workers and talent, wage inflation is the more pressing issue. Whether low unemployment causes wages to continue rising remains to be seen.Interest rates: Could higher rates inhibit economic growth? Keep in mind that the Fed is tasked with promoting maximum employment and keeping prices stable; economic growth isnât among its mandates.Bottom line: A more normalized rate environment could provide the Fed with additional dry powder to expand monetary policy by lowering interest rates if needed. Â Despite higher rates, bonds lost only nominal amounts in 2018, and short-term Treasuries provided much-needed stability when stocks sold off in the third quarter.Treasury yield curve: Investors remain concerned about the flattening yield curve, as an inverted yield curve can signal that a recession is on the horizon. Recently, parts of the short end of the curve have, in fact, inverted. However, there are two important caveats: First, parts of the yield curve do invert from time to time, and the most-watched portion between 2- and 10-year Treasuries is not inverted at the time of this writing. Second, even in times of a more pronounced curve inversion, a recession is typically one to two years off.Investment-grade, high-yield bonds: Higher short-term rates could provide income opportunities with lower risk than more rate-sensitive long-term bonds and income-oriented equities. And, unless the economy falls into recession, default rates are likely to stay low. This could make corporate bonds attractive, although credit spreads are still quite tight.Bottom line: Higher rates could provide investors with additional yield opportunities, and there are certainly relative value opportunities available.In August, a long-running equity bull market became the longest on record since World War II. Since then, however, stocks have been roiled by volatility. Will the markets remain unsettled in 2019?Growth vs. value: Growth stocks have outperformed value shares for the better part of the past decade, including the past year. However, given the Fedâs more restrictive monetary policy, it remains to be seen whether growth stocks can continue their pattern of dominanceâespecially since value stocks have the potential to outperform in more defensive environments that emphasize individual stock selection.Small caps vs large caps: At the onset of the current trade war, it was thought that tariffs would affect large, global firms more than small companies with US-focused operations. Nonetheless, small caps have underperformed large caps in 2018, and we appear to be late in the business cycle. If the economy slows, large caps could be better positioned to navigate more challenging long-term market conditions.US vs international equities: On the heels of a strong 2017, international equities disappointed in 2018. But with compelling valuations and low correlations to US equities, international equities have important implications for portfolio diversification.Bottom line: Valuations for both international equities and value stocks remain compelling.With the midterm elections in the rear-view mirror, investors finally have at least one issue of uncertainty resolved. A November E*TRADE survey found that more than half of survey respondentsâparticularly young investorsâexpected the midterm results to benefit them financially. Nonetheless, headwinds remain in the form of ongoing trade disputes, higher interest rates, and soaring budget deficits that leave few fiscal tools available to fine-tune the economy.While large-cap growth stocks led the bull run in previous years, in 2019 this could change if the market stops advancing in lockstep and assets become uncorrelated. In that environment, individual stock selection and a focus on company fundamentals could come to the forefront.Mike LoewengartVice President, Investment StrategyE*TRADE Capital Management, LLCMike Loewengart is the Vice President of Investment Strategy for E*TRADE Capital Management, LLC.

This incident happened over a closed room meeting today. But then despite the odds US Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts was reported to be voting in favor of the spending compromise which are being negotiated by President Obama and the congressional republics.The deal is going to extend the tax cut implemented during the Bush era. Many of the Democrats have for a long time opposed the extension of subsidized rate for the family with a monthly income of $250,000 it was insisted by the republicans that the taxes must not be raised on a weak economy such as this. John Kerry saidI oppose extending the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy and have voted against them since day one, every time in between, and opposed them when I ran for president,But the unavoidable reality remains that week after week, vote after vote, Senate Republicans marched in lockstep to hold middle class tax cuts and unemployment insurance hostage to bonus tax cuts only for the wealthiest AmericansKerry mentioned that he was acting on the behalf of the laid off workers who were facing lesser benefits.

Hall & Lieberman (2001) define monopoly as
			a market where only one provider of goods or services exists without close substitutes. The authors further define
			market as "a group of buyers and sellers with the potential to trade". In the example of a Cable TV provider,
			the economy in which the monopoly exists is circumscribed by the boundaries of the governmental institution that
			authorized it - this can be city, county or statewide. In the case of global monopolies like the Organization of
			Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the market is global. However, monopoly markets are not necessarily confined
			by geography but instead by barriers like economies of scale, control of scarce inputs and government regulation.
			From analysis of these definitions I conclude that the effect of changes in global economy is proportional to the
			extent in which a monopoly extends through the global economy in terms of its inputs, processes and outputs.

			For example, Malpass in National Review Online describes the breakdown of OPEC's monopoly as "due in part,
			to Russia's growing relationship with the Bush administration." Malpass goes on to say that because of the
			growing relationship between the US and the Soviet Union, "the economic importance of Saudi Arabia and the
			Arab oil producers" was materially diminished in simple words, Arab countries were no longer in control of
			"scarce inputs" or oil. In this case, the change in relationship between two countries, the US and Soviet
			Union (a change of global economic reaching proportions) affect a global monopoly.

			Now let's take a look at what happens in Smallville USA as a direct result. The local hotel or cable television
			provided may not be impacted drastically by the events affecting OPEC, in fact the price of gasoline may be so
			small that these two monopolies may not be affected at all. Now let's think about the small gas station in town
			- you know, the one cited in the book as a monopoly which becomes a monopoly simply because of economy of scale.
			Here, another service station would have to beat the price of gas and win over the clients in order to make a profit.
			However, because the inputs to the gas station consist of refined oil products, the cost of gas may have an indirect
			impact on its level of profit. This change in global economy's effect is due to the fact that the gas station's
			(our little monopoly) input comes from the affected global oil market.

By James Hamilton Britain within the 19th century observed a chain of technological and social adjustments which proceed to steer and direct us this present day. Its reactants have been human genius, cash and impression, its crucibles the streets and associations, its catalyst time, its keep an eye on the market.In this wealthy and engaging publication, James Hamilton investigates the colourful trade among tradition and company in nineteenth-century Britain, which grew to become a centre for international trade following the economic revolution. He explores how paintings used to be made and paid for, the turns of style, and the recent calls for of a transforming into middle-class, widespread between whom have been the artists themselves.While top figures corresponding to Turner, Constable, Landseer, Coleridge, Wordsworth and Dickens are gamers the following, so too are the shoppers, financiers, creditors and industrialists; attorneys, publishers, marketers and newshounds; artists' providers, engravers, purchasers and curators; hostesses, shopkeepers and brothel keepers; quacks, charlatans and auctioneers.Hamilton brings all of them vividly to existence during this kaleidoscopic portrait of the enterprise of tradition in nineteenth-century Britain, and gives exciting and unique insights into the operating lives of a few of our so much celebrated artists.

Read or Download A Strange Business: Making Art and Money in Nineteenth-Century Britain PDFBest history booksHearts Touched by Fire: The Best of Battles and Leaders of the Civil War In July 1883, quite a few days after the 20th anniversary of the conflict of Gettysburg, a gaggle of editors on the Century journal engaged in a full of life argument: Which Civil battle conflict used to be the bloodiest conflict of all of them? One claimed it was once Chickamauga, one other chilly Harbor. The argument encouraged a brainstorm: Why no longer enable the magazine’s 125,000 readers in at the dialog by way of supplying “a sequence of papers on a number of the nice battles of the struggle to be written through officials in command on either side.
Legends, Monsters, or Serial Murderers?: The Real Story Behind an Ancient CrimeThe majority of serial homicide stories aid the consensus that serial homicide is largely an American crime—a mistaken assumption, because the usa has existed for only 250 years. what's way more most likely is that the perverse urge to continually and deliberately kill has existed all through human background, and sizeable percent of serial murders all through precedent days, the center a while, and the pre-modern period have been attributed to innovative surrogate factors: dragons, demons, vampires, werewolves, and witches.Legends, Monsters, or Serial Murderers? the genuine tale in the back of an old Crime dispels the interrelated misconceptions that serial homicide is an American crime and a comparatively contemporary phenomenon, making the unconventional argument that serial homicide is a old reality—an unrecognized truth in precedent days. famous serial murderers reminiscent of the Roman Locuta (The Poisoner); Gilles De Rais of France, a prolific serial killer of kids; Andres Bichel of Bavaria; and chinese language aristocratic serial killer T'zu-Hsi are spotlighted. This e-book presents a different viewpoint that integrates supernatural interpretations of serial killing with the heritage of actual crime, reanimating mythic entities of horror tales and offering them as genuine criminals.Book Description
When requested to call a serial assassin, most folk are inclined to contemplate American criminals who won notoriety within the twentieth century, equivalent to David Berkowitz, Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy, or Richard Ramírez. in spite of the fact that, serial homicide is neither a contemporary crime nor one basically dedicated within the United States.About the Author
Dirk C. Gibson is affiliate professor of verbal exchange and journalism on the college of latest Mexico, Albuquerque, NM. His released works contain Praeger's Serial Killing for revenue: a number of homicide for funds; Serial homicide and Media Circuses; and Clues from Killers: Serial homicide and Crime Scene Messages.---

Extra info for A Strange Business: Making Art and Money in Nineteenth-Century BritainExample textAt a more practical level, because the undergraduate experience inspires unusual loyalty among its alumni, the existence of a college makes possible much of the philanthropy to build the facilities, create the extensive libraries, and endow the professorships that allow the university to produce first-Â­rate research.  Economic development and research also complement one another.  A university is in the best position to know of discoveries in its laboratories that can 32ââ¢âChapter Two be turned into useful products and processes. Of the nine colleges founded before the American Revolution, six were still ranked in the top dozen in 2010, and all nine fit comfortably within the top one hundred.  Similarly, while few of the leading corporations from a century ago continue to be successful, or even to exist, the top five universities in 1910 were still ranked among the top five in 2010, and at least two-Â­thirds of the top twenty retained that distinction a century later.  Once a university has obtained a lofty position in the hierarchy, powerful forces help to keep it there. As research and education have come to be looked upon as vital ingredients of economic growth, countries with highly developed, knowledge-Â­based economies are all being driven by a common desire to strengthen their universities.  In doing so, most have been influenced by the success of the American system and have consciously attempted to adopt many of its features.  17 To attract more students from other parts of the world, a number of departments and even a few entire universities in Europe and elsewhere are now teaching all or many of their courses in English.

						You know what you want your business to look like. You just don't know how to get from idea to implementation.You're either:You're willing to do the work. But you don't have time or energy to waste on learning and implementing new strategies if they won't move you towards your big goals.You're determined to hit your revenue goals. But not if it means sacrificing your health, freedom, or time with your loved ones.And you're motivated to build your business. But sometimes you need others to give you a push, call you on your excuses, or remind you that you've GOT this.Between home life, your current workload and social obligations, you can't seem to find the time to do it all while also learning the new software and skills to grow your business. Fraudy feelings make you want to hide behind your computer screen. You lack the confidence to commit to any decision, because what if you fail or waste your money and time on the wrong things?You want a reliable process for getting the "yes!" that doesn't feel pushy, so you can sell with integrity, get more of the RIGHT clients, and shake your moneymaker while standing by your values.You lose steam when it's time to implement ideas. You know if you focused on THE ONE THING that would generate the most money for as long as it took to plan and execute it, you'd scale faster.You work outside your zone of genius because you struggle to give up control. You hold yourself back because you go it alone. But if you had accountability, you know you'd accomplish more.I had (get this) no food in the fridge but a family to feed, $100,000 of debt, and one cricut machine that was my final hope.I sold it, made $120, and was able to buy groceries and put gas in my car.But I knew if my life was going to change for good, my business habits and mindset had to change too . . .If I was playing at the level of a $30k small business owner, how could I ever expect to create the reality of a 6-figure one?So I swallowed my pride and asked my mom to borrow money for a coach as a last ditch effort to get my business back on track. I saw a 400% return on that investment, but better yet, I found the confidence and clarity I needed to get my business moving.For years, I'd been trying to solve the growth puzzle. To figure out what separates successful entrepreneurs who get traction from the ones who stay stuck at the same income level, year after year.And you know what I was shocked to realized?It's rarely a lack of time, tight funds or slow Internet connection that's holding us back from going after what we want. It's our lack of self-belief, direction and accountability.Working day in and day out or being a relentless overachiever is not going to help you succeed in business if you don't believe that you CAN . . . or deserve to.No matter what you want to achieve in your business, if you've got underlying fraudy feelings that tell you a) you can't have what you want or b) those who have it are "the lucky few" who are smarter and have more free time and disposable income than you do or c) if you get it, you won't be able to handle the added responsibility . . .You'll never take the steps to level up.And this is why to this day, I believe that business coaching had the biggest impact on my business and saved me from scraping by for another 5 years. (Or quitting altogether.)We take months fiddling with website layouts or putting sticky notes on calendars and pushing them back every other week.We spend hours chasing the squirrels in our head, learning everything from Facebook ads to graphic design just to avoid paying a pro to do it. We keep trying new social media trends and marketing tactics, looking for the magic pill to solve all our problems.And all that does? Is distract us from our dreams and give us more gray hairs.By the time we show up at the business party, everyone's either gone home, we aren't as excited about our ideas anymore, or someone else is already showing off the thing we thought of months ago but were waiting to "get perfect".What if you were proactive about your goals, instead of thinking you're stuck in the same place you were last year and there's nothing you can do about it?What if you could live a fun-filled life while achieving your personal best in business?And what if you could wake up one day and be running the profitable, freedom-based business you used to be jealous of?Think about what would be possible if you knew exactly what growth strategies to focus on in your business and how to consistently execute on them.You could be the business powerhouse you hoped you'd be one day . . . in as little as 90 days.It's about believing in what's possible for you.That might be writing the damn book already to prove to yourself that you CAN follow through on your commitments . . .Creating a sustainable business model that lets you check out when your health isn't cooperating or family stuff comes up . . .Or simply having a clearer business vision and knowing what your business stands for.For me, it's making over six figures and contributing financially around my house so we can take advantage of more opportunities.It's working from home as a business coach and traveling all over the world as a keynote speaker.It's being able to take my family on a ski vacation or pick my kids up from school when they're sick. It's spending my days supporting amazing women all over the world who are grabbing their business by the horns and seizing big opportunities. (And sometimes, it's running masterminds that are too fun to be called "work".)I'm living proof that if you have goals for your business—even if you think they're out of your reach—don't wait until you can afford a custom website, break $100k, or your kids are in college to go after them.Start right now. Be a #WomanofAction.Maybe you're in the early startup phase and don't even know where to start. Maybe your business is growing, but at a snail's pace. Or maybe you're trying to bring your offline business into the (crazy intimidating) online space.Wherever you're at, the only REAL thing standing in your way of creating the business you deserve is having the right strategy, expert guidance to help you implement it, and a community of highly motivated women to hold you accountable.Content Creator | Curator | Social-ite, Carrots & PeaceIt's a 3-month online group coaching program and implementation hub for service-based women entrepreneurs like you who are tired of guessing their way to success (and doing it alone).It's a proven, step-by-step system for accomplishing your next-level goals in 90 days without losing the fun in the process.And it's the kick in the butt you need to actually get your next steps ACCOMPLISHED.If you need a big picture plan that chunks down your goals into small, doable tasks that are easier to follow and commit to . . .So you can find better ways to manage your time and energy, by focusing on the strategies that'll get you the biggest results in the least amount of time . . .And you want to do it alongside other super savvy women you can connect with, learn from and grow with . . .This practical, easy-to-implement program will show you how to get where you want to go in your business AND give you the expert guidance and community support to get there.Not only will you walk away with a solid plan for sustainable business growth, including step-by-step strategies that can be customized to meet you where you're at . . .But you'll also tap into a network of accountability partners and business besties who will be there to help you follow through and 10x the power of your efforts.This is more than a how-to training course. It's an implementation and accountability strategy.I saw a need to create an affordable and accessible crossover between peer accountability and coaching after seeing SO many business owners slip through the cracks of online courses.Self-study business programs don't work because you don't get the guidance or support you need to progress. And even when programs offer group coaching calls, it's impossible to deliver personalized feedback when you're responsible for teaching a large group.That's why I wanted Electrify to be unlike any other business coaching program out there. A blend of masterminding, coaching and accountability. A program that focused on the DOING, not just the learning. Because knowing your next steps is one thing. Actually taking them? That's where most programs fall short and Electrify Your Business steps in.MAKE REAL PROGRESS WITH SMALL ACCOUNTABILITY GROUPS
						With most online courses, you can disappear into the crowd and fall into your typical "I'll do that later" habits. Not in Electrify. Intimate accountability groups encourage engagement and give you a chance to mastermind at a highly personal level, so you move towards your big goals faster.GET TIME TO IMPLEMENT WHAT YOU LEARN AND TROUBLESHOOT CHALLENGES
  If you don't get time to implement while you learn, it's easy to get behind or lose your chance to get feedback because you haven't done the work. In Electrify, designated implementation weeks help you keep your momentum going without the risk of overwhelm.NEVER FEEL LIKE YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN WITH OUR FACEBOOK COMMUNITY 
  You don't have to figure it out on your own. Find lifelong accountability partners, friendships and networking opportunities to keep your momentum going in our private Facebook group. Ready for the next stage of growth in your business? Tap back into the community support to push you to that next level, year after year!Plus with lifetime access to the community and course content, you can easily go back and review the training materials to refresh your knowledge or reignite your motivation as you continue to scale your business.Peaceful Parenting Coach, sarahrosensweet.comWellness Coach, VITAL WellnessProfessional French Tutrice and Translator, The French EffectCARTS CLOSE IN:Co-Founder and Owner of Dress MavensSmall accountability groups mean no student is left behind.

The Productive Planner is an all-in-one goal-setting, time management and scheduling tool that helps you use power moves to accelerate your business growth and finally achieve the goals you set, year after year.&nbspSpeaker and Creator, Women Living BIGCARTS CLOSE IN:You get your login details, course schedule, and an invite to our private Facebook community as soon as you enroll.When you first join Electrify Your Business, you fill in an intake questionnaire that helps us put you with a group of women who either a) serve a complementary industry b) share similar goals and values or c) have a similar level of experience in business.Then on October 30th @ 1 PM EST, we'll be having a live kickoff call (don't worry, it'll be recorded if you can't join us) where you'll learn how to use your Productive Planner to map out the next 90 days and turn your business goals into plans.You'll see that finding your focus and taking consistent action every day isn't about better time management. It's about #powermoves.October 30th is also when you get access to the first module. Every week a new module is released, Shelagh hosts a live Q&A call to give you personal feedback. Every training week is followed by an implementation week that includes a group accountability call with our Accountability Coach, Nicole.We wrap up the end of January, but you get lifetime access to the Facebook group and membership site in case you fall behind or life happens.CARTS CLOSE IN:But most of my clients know me as a Business Coach, Growth Strategist and Speaker.(And my friends know me as a mountaineer, wannabe daredevil and proud mama bear.)After taking the traditional teaching route only to be bit by the entrepreneurial bug, I traded in my corporate paycheck to start a parenting blog and tutoring business.But it wasn't until I was the MC at a women's business conference that I discovered my true calling and began facilitating women's online business training.I have a unique background in experiential education with a Masters in Education and Certificates in Effectiveness Coaching and Strategic Intervention Coaching.That combined with my corporate leadership training inspires my practical, hands-on approach to getting you real results.My mission is to show overworked and underpaid women entrepreneurs across the globe that it IS possible to build a profitable, sustainable business—without drowning in debt, forfeiting family time, or working in their sleep. I'm always willing to open the book on my own business to help you understand what you need to move ahead.My coaching philosophy stems from the belief that you can't get ahead if you aren't supported. Sometimes that comes in the form of guidance, cheerleading, or a motivational (and loving) butt-kick in the right direction.A former middle-school teacher, Nicole decided to resign from the traditional workforce after her oldest son was born and created a work-at-home life for herself. (And as a single mom of four, let's just say she understands the challenges of building a business while raising a family more than most!) Nicole's been a social media marketing consultant and coach for 6 years, working with major brands to create a strong online presence and grow their audiences.We met in 2010 and became business besties. And after coaching her myself and experiencing her passion first-hand, I can't wait to share her heart and smarts with you!On top of my Q&A coaching calls, Nicole leads accountability group calls 2x month, so you get a level of personal support that I wouldn't be able to offer on my own.That's how dedicated I am to making sure you get the attention you need to get rapid results!Chief Unicorn, Geek UnicornSleeping in on a weekday (gasp).Falling back in love with your business.Going on more spontaneous day adventures with your kids or dates with your spouse.Finally paying off your mortgage, getting out of debt, and padding your retirement fund so you can live big (and take too many cruises when you're 70).Creating a nomadic lifestyle that lets you explore new countries, check off your bucket list, and set up shop wherever there's an internet connection.Starting a scholarship fund or charity that lifts others up, so you can leave a legacy you're proud of.And so much more . . .You can do this. Give me 3 months, and I can help you make it happen.CARTS CLOSE IN:Will I get results?I wish I could guarantee results, but I can't. Sometimes two students with access to the exact same tools get different results based on their level of knowledge, tech savvy, motivation and experience. But if you're prepared to work hard, you'll see progress.I'm just starting out. Is this for me?Electrify Your Business is for new business owners, side hustlers, and full-time entrepreneurs who are ready to starting working ON their business and not just in it. Whether you're trying to get out of the feast and famine cycle or break through the $50k/year plateau, Electrify Your Business can help. If you're already making 6-figures or more, my 1:1 coaching services are your better bet. If you're unsure about whether or not the curriculum is meant for your level of experience and want to know if it's too advanced or too basic for where you're at right now, feel free to email me at shelagh@shelaghcummins.com.What type of business owner is this course meant for?While many of the strategies are applicable to most types of businesses, this course is focused on service-based entrepreneurs. But we'll cover both online and offline branding, marketing and sales strategies.I'm already so busy . . .I totally get it! The last thing I want to do is add to your plate. But here's the thing: When you put the systems I'm going to teach you in place and prioritize the activities you focus on, every hour you spend building your business is going to pay off THAT much more. My goal is to have you seeing a bigger return on the time you invest in your business by giving you the tools, direction and support you need to scale faster and generate more revenue.How do you choose accountability groups?When you first join Electrify Your Business, you fill in an intake questionnaire that helps us put you with a group of women who either a) serve a complementary industry b) share similar goals and values or c) have a similar level of experience in business. When will the bi-weekly accountability calls with Nicole happen?When you sign up, you will be taken to an intake form. You will choose which time fits best in your schedule. The calls are held on alternating weeks. There are morning, afternoon and evening options.  All calls are held on Zoom. If you can't make it, you'll have a chance to submit your Qs ahead of time and still be able to watch the replay.When will the bi-weekly live Q&A coaching calls with you happen?The bi-weekly live Q&A calls are held on the weeks the modules are delivered.  The calls are held on alternating Thursdays at 1 PM EST via Zoom. If you can't make it, you'll have a chance to submit your Qs ahead of time and still be able to watch the replay when you have time.How do I pay?You can pay securely with Stripe.How does the membership site work?Electrify Your Business is setup on AccessAlly, which is a secure membership platform. You'll be able to login to the course materials at any time using your unique username and password and get lifetime access to the trainings.What happens after I enroll?After you enroll, you get a welcome email with your unique login details for accessing the course materials through the membership site. Each week, training material is dripped out to you, so you're not overwhelmed over the 3 months and actually have time to do the work.What's your refund policy?If after the first 2 weeks, you realize this program isn't for you, you can request a complete refund—no questions asked. The opening for refund requests closes on November 10th, 2017.What happens if I fall behind?No worries! You get lifetime access to the program, so you can pick up where you left off or revisit the course materials. That said, the students who get the best results follow along with the curriculum as closely as possible, so they can get the most out of the coaching calls and Facebook community.How much support will I get from you during the course?I'll be in the Facebook group on a daily basis to answer your Qs (just hit me up with a #heyshelagh if you want to make sure I see your specific post). I host bi-weekly live Q&As (60 min). Plus your bi-weekly accountability calls with Nicole give you a chance to get more personalized support.What's the content breakdown again?Each module in Electrify Your Business is designed to build on the next, creating systematic business growth:Module 1: Mindset
  Module 2: Money
  Module 3: Dream Customers
  Module 4: Marketing
  Module 5: Sales
  Module 6: Success PathWhen does Electrify start and end?Our kickoff call is on October 30th (which will be recorded if you can't attend). That's also when you start getting access to your bi-weekly trainings. We wrap up by end of January, but you'll have lifetime access to the Facebook group and membership site.What if my question isn't answered above?I know that making a big investment in yourself can feel scary, so if there's anything I haven't covered here that you need to know, fire away! I truly want you to succeed and I'll let you know if I think Electrify Your Business is the course that'll help you get there. You can email me directly at shelagh@shelaghcummins.com.Search

New Delhi, Aug 31 (IANS) Alarmed by the sealing and demolitions of unauthorised buildings in the Indian capital, top retailers are shifting to upcoming malls, leading to a sharp rise in property prices and rentals.

As the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), pushed by a Supreme Court order, prepares to seal over 45,000 commercial buildings operating in residential areas, a good number of fashion designers are preparing to shift out of their existing business locations.


'We have paid three times the price to find a suitable place in a mall after we had to vacate our shops because of the demolitions,' said Abhinav Sharma, a leading name in fashion design.


Sharma had a showroom in MG-I on the Delhi-Guragon road, the hub of fashion stores that was demolished by MCD in February.


Earlier, he used to pay around Rs.60,000 a month as rent for the MG-I showroom but now has to shell out around Rs.200,000.


'The prices have gone up because there are not many good places where designers can start a showroom, so we are being charged hefty prices for the space,' he said.


Taking note of the demand for high-standard malls, especially after the continued sealing and demolitions, real estate developers like the DLF Group are constructing swanky malls along the Delhi-Gurgaon road, which could see a second life as the fashion destination of Delhi.


'We are constructing a mall on the MG road as it was the centre of Delhi's fashion industry. Though the mall is under construction people have booked space at a rate of Rs.175 per square foot,' said a DLF manager who did not want to be named.


Agreeing that property prices have gone up steeply in the capital, mall developers say the trend would continue for a while.


'We are charging Rs.150 per square foot area for rent and Rs.500,000 per square foot in case of lease,' said Aarti, senior manager of East Delhi Mall.


On their part, MCD officials are preparing to start the process of re-sealing and demolition once again.


'Talks have been going on with Delhi Police as we suspect people might try to interfere in our work,' said one MCD official.


The process had been stopped in May after the central government enacted the Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Act seeking to halt the demolition and sealing drives in the national capital.


However, the Supreme Court Aug 10 ordered the resumption of the drive.


The court stayed the urban development ministry's notification that directed de-sealing of the sealed premises and allowed those that had given an undertaking to stop the commercial activity by June 30 to continue it beyond that day.


The sealing drive had been undertaken following an order of the court to put a stop to the misuse of residential properties for commercial purposes.

    by Bill Keller
    published by Times Books.
    © 2003 by Bill KellerFrom Publishers Weekly
          The topography of class in America has shifted over the past twenty 
          years, blurring the lines between upper, middle and lower classes; some 
          have argued that the concept of class is irrelevant in today's society. 
          While the 14 pieces in this volume (all originally printed as part of 
          a New York Times series) shed light on a different aspect of class, 
          they all agree that it remains an important facet of contemporary American 
          culture and draw their strength by examining class less through argument 
          than through storytelling. The reader, by following three heart attack 
          victims through very different recoveries, by witnessing the divergent 
          immigrant experiences of a Greek diner owner and his Mexican line cook, 
          by tracing the life path of an Appalachian foster child turned lawyer 
          and a single welfare mother turned registered nurse, or by seeing the 
          world from the perspective of the wife of a "relo" (a six-figure 
          executive who relocates every few years to climb the corporate ladder), 
          quickly realizes class is defined by much more than income. The collection 
          has the power of a great documentary film: it captures the lives and 
          ideas of its subjects in lively, articulate prose that, while grounded 
          in statistics and research, remains engaging and readable throughout. 
          The result is neither an attack on the rich nor a lecture to the poor, 
          but a thoughtful consideration of class dynamics. Its empathetic take 
          on this divisive subject and straightforward prose style will make the 
          book of interest to a wide range of readers. Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier

E-business is everywhere. Most newspapers and magazines carry articles about the hottest new idea for conducting commerce over the Internet. But what is the truth behind the e-business world? How does it operate? How and why does a business go on-line?As e-commerce increasingly creeps into all facets of everyday life we need to understand how e-business evolved, the technologies and business models that drive it, the threat it poses to traditional business models, and how it is likely to grow in the future. In this course  we aim to provide an answer to these questions and to develop a fuller understanding of e-business opportunities.I would like to study Business Management at university, as I am interested in current affairs and am curious about the real worldBusiness management will teach and help me how to manage people; how to make and carry out decisions; and how to assess markets. It is a broad subject, which will develop my ability to think logically and creativelyThe subjects I am studying at A-level will be relevant to Business Management as Economics is mainly a written subject where accurate use of English is essential. Memorizing economic concepts are crucial in understanding the environment in which businesses operate; it also helps to improve your memory. Learning different market structures such as monopoly and perfect competition is important and in Business Management my knowledge will be further broadened. Economics is a strong A-level subject- most professional careers demand a course in economics as part of training. To run a business we must be aware of the economyI enjoy studying law as it has widened my scope on problems in our society. It has taught me how the law is made, enforced and how it affects us. I have developed skills of research, analytical and problem solving skills, I also have the ability to select relevant legal authority and evidence, for example, relevant cases and statutes. Law is crucial for businesses as it guides you on what you can and cannot do. E.U Law is crucial as in 1989, a 'Charter of Fundamental Social Rights for Workers' was adopted by 11 of the then 12 Member States of the European Union. Many initiatives on improving the working conditions of E.U citizens were out forward. Employment rights such as health and safety protection; protection of pregnant women; the right to annual paid holidays and improved social and professional integration for the disabled are essential if a business is to succeedFrom sociology, I have learnt the theories and views of well-known sociologists such as Karl Marx and many others. I carried out a research report on a piece of sociological research and have written a challenging essay of two thousand words. Sociology has helped me to develop skills of research, analysing evidence and theory, dealing with competing arguments in written and oral reports. Sociology is relevant to many areas of management such as Personnel Management, which deals with issues of unfair dismissal that could be due to gender or race, for exampleI am interested in reading, films and music. I have been to the theatre and I enjoyed the experience. I like to keep in touch with what news is making the headlines and therefore try to read newspapers when I canI like to show creativity by cooking and designing decorative henna patterns for use on the handsI hope to gain knowledge of Business Management and for studying at university to provide me with a starting point in my career.                       Article by TSR User on Thursday 15 February 2018                                         I have always been a very determined, proactive, hardworking and ambitious person. I am very interested in business and inspired by entrepreneurs who have made a success of their businesses e.g. Peter Jones. I have enjoyed my college course and this is why I want to study business at University.My BTEC National Diploma in Business course at college has been very interesting and helpful. I have learnt a lot about how businesses run and specifically the different areas of business including marketing research, relationship marketing, human resources and administration. Also, I have learned many new skills for example being able to research and learn independently and being able to work towards deadlines with my assignments. I have consistently achieved distinctions in my assignments and am on track to getting a distinction for my final grade.I feel I want to go to university because it will help me expand my skills and gain a lot of knowledge that will help me in life when looking for a career. I also feel that studying at university will allow me to demonstrate my strong hard-working ethic and take on new experiences.Since September 2007, I have been working part time for Tesco. This has provided me with an opportunity to work as part of a team co-operating with others but at the same time also working independently. I have been able to learn new skills, for example being able to deal with the public and use my own initiative. Also I think working at a big company has given me an insight into how a large business operates. I am always very organised and prepared and have good time keeping record. These qualities have been reflected in the fact that I have had good reports from my managers and have met my targets. I have always been conscientious, not only at Tesco but in similar jobs at Homebase and Asda.I was a prefect and a peer mentor at school, which reflects the fact that I am reliable and have good interpersonal skills. My interests include playing and watching sports especially football. Also I like to see my friends and regularly go to the cinema. I am currently learning to drive.I am a reliable, motivated and organised student, who enjoys experiencing new challenges and always gives their all. I am looking forward to the experience and challenges of university life.

If you are not sure about either the area or the category leave the choice to "Display All". You have to specify only one of "Category" or "Region".Durch den Businessplan bereiten Sie sich optimal auf Ihre GrÃ¼ndung vor. Damit vermeiden Sie einen der hÃ¤ufigsten GrÃ¼nde fÃ¼r ein vorzeitiges Scheitern Ihres Businessplans: mangelnde Planung. Sie erstellen den Businessplan fÃ¼r sich selbst, aber auch fÃ¼r Banken und Investoren, um das notwendige Kapital fÃ¼r Ihre UnternehmensgrÃ¼ndung zu erhalten. Mit dem Businessplan legen Sie den Grundstein fÃ¼r Ihre Stiftung. Das kostenlose Businessplan-Tool ermÃ¶glicht es Ihnen, einfach und sicher Ihren eigenen Businessplan zu erstellen.Jeder Beginn ist schwierig: Das spÃ¼ren wir auch daran, dass wir von Ihnen immer mehr Anfragen zur Gestaltung von GeschÃ¤ftsidee, Planungsprozessen etc. haben. Daher werden in den folgenden Artikeln die Bereiche Idee, wesentliche Fragestellungen vor Beginn der SelbstÃ¤ndigkeit, Business Plan und Finanzierungen behandelt. Wir beginnen mit dem Brainstorming - wir hoffen, im Verlauf der Serie einige Antworten geben zu kÃ¶nnen.Wenn man sich entscheidet, sich selbstÃ¤ndig zu machen, gibt es oft schon AnsÃ¤tze oder eine Anregung. Vom Auto zum Beton zu gelangen, bedeutet, sich Zeit fÃ¼r aktives "Drehen" zu lassen und Ã¼ber die eigene Lage und die denkbaren Chancen nachzudenken. Nachfolgend einige einfache Kreativtechniken, die oft zu Ã¼berraschenden Ergebnissen fÃ¼hren: Klassisches Ideenfindung wird empfohlen, bei der Sie verschiedene Leute bitten, zusammenzukommen und alle Vorstellungen zu einem bestimmten Themenbereich auszusprechen.Das Sammeln dieser Vorstellungen kann dann gegliedert werden. An dieser Stelle werden die genannten und viele andere kreative Techniken vorgestellt, die alle dazu beitragen, aus den Ã¼blichen Denkpfaden herauszukommen und neue Impulse zu geben. Tip: Schauen Sie nicht zu eng nach einer Idee, sondern geben Sie Ihren Ãberlegungen freien Lauf und Sie erhalten trotzdem die besten Resultate.Viele Gedanken kommen zum Beispiel in der Duschkabine, in der Toilettenkabine oder vor dem Schlafengehen auf. Jede Ideenfindung stÃ¶Ãt an ihre Grenze, wenn wesentliche Erkenntnisse nicht vorliegen, z.B. wenn Fragen zur Machbarkeit, Marktlage etc. nicht bekannt sind. Wenn die allgemeine Ausrichtung eindeutig ist, ist es sinnvoll, sich an den derzeitigen Absatzmarkt zu wenden und alle verfÃ¼gbaren Daten zu sammeln.Es gibt unterschiedliche MÃ¶glichkeiten, einen Ãberblick Ã¼ber den gewÃ¼nschten Absatzmarkt zu gewinnen: Ein Einstieg kann ein persÃ¶nliches GesprÃ¤chsthema mit Kolleginnen und Kollegen sein. Denn hier ist es leicht, in alle Himmelsrichtungen zu befragen und Tendenzen und Probleme aufzuspÃ¼ren. Doch: Bei letzterer ist nie mit Gewissheit davon auszugehen, dass alles Wesentliche aufgezeichnet wurde, daher sollte das Netz nur einen Teil der Orientierungsgrundlage darstellen.Wer einen groben Eindruck hat, sollte sich die Wettbewerbssituation auf dem Arbeitsmarkt nÃ¤her ansehen: Idealerweise wird der Gedanke mit jedem weiteren Betrachtungsschritt weiterentwickelt. Dies ist im Grunde genommen erfreulich, da immer wieder neue EinfÃ¤lle auftauchen. Schon bald sollte man nicht nur neue Impulse geben, sondern sie auch zu Papier bringen und sorgfÃ¤ltig abwÃ¤gen.Ich schlage vor, dass Sie die folgenden Anfragen in schriftlicher Form beantworten: Was gibt es fÃ¼r Marktinformationen? Gerade diese Fragestellungen bilden die Basis eines jeden Businessplanes. Hinweis: Diese Frage ist nicht nur fÃ¼r Sie von Bedeutung, sondern kann auch genutzt werden, um Ihre Idee zukÃ¼nftigen Partnern oder Sponsoren zu prÃ¤sentieren.In der folgenden Eingabe gehen wir dann auf die Einzelkomponenten des GeschÃ¤ftsplans nÃ¤her ein. Erstellung eines Business Plans Schritt 2: WofÃ¼r ist er da? Und wer wird mir helfen? Bevor grÃ¶Ãere Ãnderungen im Betrieb und im Absatzmarkt, sei es die Basis, sei es eine neue ProdukteinfÃ¼hrung oder eine Erweiterung, sollten Sie einen GeschÃ¤ftsplan erstellen.Wer jedoch Ã¼ber den eigenen Bedarf nachdenkt und nichts anderes fÃ¼r den GeschÃ¤ftsplan benÃ¶tigt, kann oft noch nicht berÃ¼cksichtigte Aspekte aufdecken. Warum ein GeschÃ¤ftsplan? Der GeschÃ¤ftsplan verhilft nach einer erfolgreichen GeschÃ¤ftsidee bei Detailfragen zu den Themen MÃ¤rkten, Wettbewerb, Vermarktung und Kostenrechnung zu einem vertieften VerstÃ¤ndnis der eigenen GeschÃ¤ftssituation und des Marktes, gibt damit Entscheidungssicherheit und gibt Auftrieb.Damit ist der Business Plan zunÃ¤chst eine Roadmap durch eine eigene Anfangs- und Entwicklungsphase. Hinweis: Der GeschÃ¤ftsplan wÃ¤chst ebenso schnell wie das Unter-nehmen. Der GeschÃ¤ftsplan fungiert auf lange Sicht als Orientierung fÃ¼r ExistenzgrÃ¼nder und Arbeitnehmer, da die Unternehmensausrichtung, die Unternehmensziele und -strategie festgelegt und ein FÃ¼hrungssystem fÃ¼r die Unternehmenssteuerung geschaffen wird.Mit einer guten Wartung kann der GeschÃ¤ftsplan nicht nur eine ungefÃ¤hre Orientierungshilfe sein, sondern auch dazu beitragen, Soll-Ist-Vergleiche vorzunehmen, FlaschenhÃ¤lse zu identifizieren und eigene Vorstellungen zu befragen. Korrekt erstellt und graphisch ansprechend, kann der Business Plan auch als FirmenprÃ¤sentation fÃ¼r den Kundenkontakt genutzt werden. Jeder, der einen GeschÃ¤ftsplan entwickelt, kennt auch den Absatzmarkt, das eigene Unternehmen, die eigenen Zielsetzungen, die eigenen Strategie und die Kostenplanung und muss nicht vor Diskussionen zurÃ¼ckschrecken, sondern kann im Gegenteil Wissen Ã¼bertrumpfen.FÃ¼r einen GeschÃ¤ftsplan mÃ¼ssen erst nach der Entwicklung der Idee Fragestellungen zur angestrebten Gesellschaftsform beantwortet werden. Eine erste Ãbersicht fÃ¼r kleine Start-ups finden Sie im Beitrag zur SelbstÃ¤ndigkeit neben Studien und Beruf. Derartige GrÃ¼ndungsinitiativen sind in der Regel kostenfrei und fÃ¼hren Sie von der Konzeption Ã¼ber den Business Plan bis hin zu den ersten Unternehmensschritten.Nun zum Wesentliche, dem GeschÃ¤ftsplan selbst und seiner Erstellung. Wir haben bereits an anderer Stelle darauf hingewiesen, dass die Erstellung von BusinessplÃ¤nen sehr aufwÃ¤ndig und zeitintensiv ist. Zahlreiche wesentliche Teile des GeschÃ¤ftsplans wirken folgerichtig und werden rasch aufbereitet. Tip: Sie wollen den GeschÃ¤ftsplan nicht an einem einzigen Tag erstellen. Schon allein der Rahmen eines Business Plans macht es notwendig, etwas mehr Zeit zu planen: Er kann zwischen 10 und 30 Blatt umfassen, je nachdem, wie kompliziert das Stiftungsprojekt und der jeweilige Zielmarkt sind und welche Voraussetzungen (z.B. ÃberprÃ¼fung durch Finanzierer oder Banken) der Business Plan erfÃ¼llen soll.Tip: SchlÃ¼ssige Formulierung, aber haarfeine Einzelheiten kÃ¶nnen weggelassen werden. Einen Businessplan zu erstellen ist eine herausfordernde Aufgabe: Er sollte so anschaulich sein, dass der Nutzer sich etwas unter den einzelnen Punkten vorstellt, es aber auch technisch richtig und ausfÃ¼hrlich ausdrÃ¼cken kann. Man kann sich beim Verfassen von Texten gut vor Augen fÃ¼hren, dass jemand aus einem ganz anderen Gebiet den Plan gelesen hat und ihn trotzdem versteht - der Lesende sollte immer an die Wand gegriffen werden.Falls Sie sich nicht ganz sicher sind, ob Ihr GeschÃ¤ftsplan dies zulÃ¤sst, lassen Sie es sich von ein Paar Freunden durchlesen und bewerten, wie spannend und leicht es ist. Der GeschÃ¤ftsplan sollte fÃ¼r einen raschen und Ã¼bersichtlichen Aufbau sorgen, denn nicht jeder kennt die gesamte BroschÃ¼re. Inhaltsverzeichnisse am Anfang sowie gleichmÃ¤Ãige Rubriken und Gliederungen in Themenparagraphen sollten fÃ¼r einen GeschÃ¤ftsplan selbstverstÃ¤ndlichkeit sein.FÃ¼r einen GrobÃ¼berblick verwenden die meisten Interessierten zunÃ¤chst die Businessplan-Zusammenfassung, die den Plan einfÃ¼hrt. Die Kurzfassung legt fest, ob der restliche Businessplan Ã¼berhaupt noch zu lesen ist. Tip: Schreibe die Kurzfassung zuletzt, denn dann sind die wichtigsten Aspekte in den Detailkapiteln bereits ausgearbeitet und man muss nur noch zusammentragen.Der GeschÃ¤ftsplan verfolgt nach dieser Ãbersicht eine ungefÃ¤hre Struktur, die in der Regel dieser entspricht: Hier werden die folgenden Aspekte im Detail ausgearbeitet:

ÀÑCopyright (C) övàc@l_ËsYÆU»àc@All Rights Reserved.Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) are powered by hydrogen. They are more efficient than conventional internal combustion engine vehicles and produce no tailpipe emissions—they only emit water vapor and warm air. FCEVs and the hydrogen infrastructure to fuel them are still in an early stage of deployment. The U.S. Department of Energy is leading government and industry efforts to make hydrogen-powered vehicles an affordable, environmentally friendly, and safe transportation option. Hydrogen is considered an alternative fuel under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and qualifies for alternative fuel vehicle tax credits.FCEVs use a propulsion system similar to that of electric vehicles, where energy stored as hydrogen is converted to electricity by the fuel cell. Unlike conventional internal combustion engine vehicles, they produce no harmful tailpipe emissions. Other benefits include increasing U.S. energy security and strengthening the economy.FCEVs are fueled with pure hydrogen gas stored in a tank on the vehicle. Similar to conventional internal combustion engine vehicles, they can fuel in less than 5 minutes and have a driving range over 300 miles. FCEVs are equipped with other advanced technologies to increase efficiency, such as regenerative braking systems, which capture the energy lost during braking and store it in a battery. Major automobile manufacturers are offering a limited number of production FCEVs to the public in certain markets, in sync with what the developing infrastructure can support.The most common type of fuel cell for vehicle applications is the polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell. In a PEM fuel cell, an electrolyte membrane is sandwiched between a positive electrode (cathode) and a negative electrode (anode). Hydrogen is introduced to the anode and oxygen (from air) to the cathode. The hydrogen molecules break apart into protons and electrons because of an electrochemical reaction in the fuel cell catalyst. Protons travel through the membrane to the cathode.The electrons are forced to travel through an external circuit to perform work (providing power to the electric car) then recombine with the protons on the cathode side, where the protons, electrons, and oxygen molecules combine to form water. See the fuel cell animation or the Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) infographic to learn more about the process.More Hydrogen Data | All Maps & DataMore Hydrogen Case Studies | All Case StudiesMore Hydrogen Publications | All PublicationsAll ToolsYour zip code ${/spectrumbusinessprofile/zipcode}Your current location is ${/spectrumbusinessprofile/zipcode}.

Develop a sound business planSuccessful entrepreneurs do a lot of background research before they sell their products and services. A business plan pulls it all together. Your plan should include:Try our interactiveÂ Scotia Plan WriterÂ for businessÂ®2. Invest in your own education
Self-education could be as specific as learning how the latest piece of software can help your business. Or it could be mastering the different skills youâll need to run your business, such as marketing, finance, and customer service. The more you can learn about the overall operations of your business, the better your decisions will be - particularly if you run a smaller company that requires you to take more than one role.3. Get your finances in order
Save as much money as you canÂ beforeÂ you start your business; you may need to draw on your savings in the early stages. You should also establish and maintain a good credit history, which will help you when you need to borrow money for your business.4. Keep your overhead low
There are many stories of entrepreneurs starting out in their garages until they have built up their business. Starting small and keeping your costs low lets you make mistakes on a much smaller scale and gives you the time to learn from them. Email and the Internet make it easy to start your business from your home.5. Learn from the experts
Take advantage of the expertise of an accountant and business banker. An accountant can help you with the books, find ways to keep your costs low, and do your tax return. Your business banker will be able to guide you on cash flow, the use of credit, investments, and borrowing, among other things. He or she can also share best business practices.Astute observation and sound judgement are a great start to understanding your customers and market. Here are a few easy ways for you to get toÂ know your customers and your market.

Dezember 28, 2018 Extracting Clinical Research Data From the EHR Using SMART on FHIRLearn more about Business Review WebinarsIf you have previously registered for this event, please login below:All fields below are required.Clinical research is probably the last industry on the planet where data can only be moved from one computer system to another by typing it in again. Why canât the requisite data be extracted automatically from the patientâs Electronic Health Record? For years, this has been deemed impossible for a variety of technical, regulatory and patient privacy reasons. 


However, with the advent of a new architecture called SMART and a new communications protocol called FHIR, the automatic extraction of data from the EHR is now eminently feasible. 


Join us for a webinar to understand this ground-breaking new technology and what it means for the future of Clinical Data Management.  Kim Rejndrup, senior vice president â Product Development, is helping drive OmniCommâs products to new levels of innovation. Mr. Rejndrup spent nearly 20 years at Oracle Corporation, where he was a vice president of Development for many clinical research applications, including systems for electronic data capture (EDC), clinical trials management, data management, medical coding and data warehousing.
Mr. Howells has served as the Companyâs chief technology officer since June 2017. He served as Senior Vice President of Development from April 2012 until June 2017. He joined OmniComm in January 2011, with responsibility for the development and forward direction of the companyâs products. 


Mr. Howells has more than 20 years of experience in building and implementing clinical research applications, including five years as head of development for Oracle's pharmaceutical application suite and five years as head of development for Medidata Solutions. This encompasses applications for clinical data management, EDC, medical dictionary coding, safety, trial planning and trial budgeting. Mr. Howells has a degree in physics from Oxford University, England.You can find Business Review Webinars on Social Media platforms.

Federal Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna tactfully welcomed Saskatchewan’s climate change plan, “Prairie Resilience: A Made-in-Saskatchewan Climate Change Strategy”, released December 4, 2017. Saskatchewan’s plan doesn’t set greenhouse gas reduction targets or propose a price on carbon. Instead, it promises a range of regulatory measures, the use of offsets, and various measures to adapt to a changing climate.McKenna believes Saskatchewan, the lone provincial holdout on carbon pricing, is taking a step in that direction with this plan. The plan calls for the development of “sector-specific output-based performance standards on facilities emitting more than 25,000 tonnes of CO2e per year.” Facilities that fail to meet these standards will have several compliance options, which include purchasing credits from better performers or paying into a technology fund.There are exemptions, explains Brendan Frank, analyst with Canada’s Ecofiscal Commission. Coverage will be minimal, but compliance with the standards could take the form of carbon pricing.“It’s probably not enough to satisfy the requirements of the Pan-Canadian Framework [on Clean Growth and Climate Change] and therefore likely not enough for Saskatchewan to avoid the federal backstop,” Frank tells EcoLog News.The plan isn’t a complete bust, says Frank. It acknowledges the importance of adaptation, for instance, with proposals around community preparedness, transportation and infrastructure. It addresses emissions from agriculture, an important source of emissions, particularly in Saskatchewan, and one that is largely insulated from the impacts of carbon pricing. The province will develop and implement an offset system that will create more incentives in the agricultural and forestry sectors for carbon sequestration and reduced emissions.Saskatchewan’s plan is also the first one in Canada to acknowledge “internationally transferred mitigation outcomes” (ITMOs — the term coined in the Paris Agreement for internationally traded offsets and allowances) as a compliance mechanism for large emitters, says Frank.But the absence of a broad-based carbon price, as called for in the Pan-Canadian Framework, may prove to be its fatal flaw. McKenna suggests as much in her statement:“Based on what’s in today’s plan, Saskatchewan’s price likely wouldn’t hit our standard, because it applies only to heavy industry instead of being economy-wide,” she said. “Of course, we hope that will change as Saskatchewan’s government turns its plan into action.”Frank labels it a missed opportunity. Regulatory measures are likely to come at a higher cost to the economy than a carbon price. And the revenue from a carbon price can readily be recycled into the Saskatchewan economy to achieve any number of worthwhile goals.With a carbon tax at $20 per tonne, Frank says Saskatchewan could probably raise $800 million. That would be enough to eliminate the corporate income tax, he says, or pay a quarterly dividend of $175 to every Saskatchewan resident.“A carbon tax doesn’t necessarily mean paying more tax,” he says. “It just means changing the way taxes are paid.”Back to Headlines | Top of Page¹æÅº¼Ò³â´Ü ºôº¸µå Å°¿öµå°¡ °¡¿ä°è¸¦ °­Å¸ÇÏ¸é¼­ ±× ¹è°æ¿¡ °ü½ÉÀÌ ¶ß°Ì´Ù.21ÀÏ ±¹³» À¯¸í ¿Â¶óÀÎ Ä¿¹Â´ÏÆ¼ °Ô½ÃÆÇ¿¡´Â ‘¹æÅº¼Ò³â´Ü ºôº¸µå, ´ëÁßµµ ¸ô¶ú´ø ±×µéÀÇ ½ÅÈ­’¶ó¸ç ±×µéÀÇ ¾÷Àû¿¡ ´ëÇÑ ±ÛµéÀÌ ¼Ó¼Ó ¿Ã¶ó¿À¸é¼­ ¶ß°Å¿î ÀÌ½´°¡ ¶Ç ´Ù¸¥ ÀÌ½´¸¦ ³º°í ÀÖ´Ù.¹æÅº¼Ò³â´Ü ºôº¸µå°¡ ÀÌÃ³·³ À½¿ø ½ÃÀåÀÇ ºòÀÌ½´·Î ÀÚ¸®ÀâÀº ÀÌÀ¯´Â »ç½Ç»ó ¶Ç ´Ù¸¥ Àü¼³·Î ÀÚ¸®¸Å±èÇÏ°í ÀÖ´Â ÀÎ±â±×·ì ¹æÅº¼Ò³â´ÜÀÌ Ú¸ 'ºôº¸µå ¹ÂÁ÷ ¾î¿öÁî'¿¡¼­ ´ëÇÑ¹Î±¹ ¹ÂÁö¼Ç ÃÖÃÊ·Î 2³â ¿¬¼Ó ¼ö»óÇÏ´Â ±â¿°À» ÅäÇß±â ¶§¹®.‘¹æÅº¼Ò³â´Ü ºôº¸µå’°¡ ÀÌ·± Ãß¼¼¶ó¸é 3³â ¿¬¼Ó ¼ö»óµµ °¡´ÉÇÑ °Í ¾Æ´Ï³Ä´Â °üÃøÀÌ ³ª¿À´Â °Ç ÀÌ ¶§¹®ÀÌ´Ù.¹æÅº¼Ò³â´Ü ºôº¸µå »Ó ¾Æ´Ï¶ó ±×µéÀÌ ÇöÀç °¡¿ä½ÃÀå¿¡¼­ ¼­¼úÇÏ°í ÀÖ´Â Àü¼³Àû Çàº¸´Â ´Ü¼øÇÑ Áßµ¶¼ºÀ¸·Î º¸±â¿£, ±× À½¾ÇÀû Æ÷ÀÎÆ®°¡ ´Ù¸¥ °¡¼öµéµÂ 180µµ ´Ù¸£´Ù´Â Æò°¡´Ù.°ü·Ã ´º½º¸¦ Á¢ÇÑ ÆÒµé°ú ´©¸®²ÛµéÀº “¿òÁ÷ÀÌ¸é ¿ÃÅ³” “¼½½Ã Æ÷ÅÙ ÅÍÁ³´Ù” “·Î¸ÇÆ½ º¸ÀÌ½º, Áö±ÝºÎÅÍ Âß °¡ÀÚ” µîÀÇ ¹ÝÀÀÀ» º¸ÀÌ°í ÀÖ´Ù.ÀÌ¹ÌÁö = ¼Ò¼Ó»ç Á¦°øÀÌÄÚ³ë¹ÌÅå´º½º, ECONOMYTALKÁÖ´Ù¿µ ÀÌÄÚ³ë¹ÌÅå´º½º ±âÀÚ  pr@economytalk.kr<ÀúÀÛ±ÇÀÚ © ÀÌÄÚ³ë¹ÌÅå´º½º, ¹«´Ü ÀüÀç ¹× Àç¹èÆ÷ ±ÝÁö>

There are various reasons why you may feel nervous:There are many more reasons beyond this why you get nervous. You could be nervous just because it's an interview and people are supposed to be nervous! This article will teach you how to calm yourself before an interview, how to handle the jitters during an interview, as well as some of my own experiences.There are steps you need to take prior to going into the interview and prior to the interview itself. These steps will allow you to calm yourself before an interview. I have used these techniques myself, and they work.Essentially, you want to prepare yourself for every contingency ahead of time. If you forget something, end up running late, or something else happens prior to the interview, it will just add to your nervousness. If you don't have your act together, the interviewer may see that as well.Once you are sitting in the waiting room, you can find your nervousness grow. Use these tips to calm yourself before the interview:These are general tips you can use when having an interview of any kind, whether it be on the phone, one-on-one, or a panel.One-on-one interviews are more intimate in a way that the interviewer will have all eyes on you, and your eyes will always be on them. This can be a good or bad thing, depending how you handle yourself. Here are some tips on how to handle your nervousness during a one-on-one interview.Panel interviews can be much harder to contend with. Not only do you have to endure an interview, you have to do it in front of multiple people. That could just compound your nervousness, making it harder for you to sell yourself. Use these tips on how to alleviate that nervousness during a panel interview.I have a few experiences I can share when it comes to being nervous during a job interview, which can provide some insight on how being nervous can affect your chances of getting a job.Â© 2013 David Livermoreby Cynthia Hoover3by chirls9by David Livermore6by Sally Hayes5by Pamela Oglesby29by Igor Hulz0by Lisa4by Annette Thomas12Sign in or sign up and post using a HubPages Network account.No HTML is allowed in comments, but URLs will be hyperlinked.

I tend to be more nervous with panel interviews though, so prefer one-to-one.hyp 5 years ago Thank you for sharing your experience. I'm always feel nervous during interview. I'll remember your tips.Jim Niemela 5 years ago from UtahGreat post!  Thanks for the tips.Elizabeth Parker 5 years ago from Las Vegas, NVGreat tips.  I worked in staffing for a while and even though I know the tactics to use and many tips, I still found myself nervous when I had to go on interviews. I think it's important to remember that you are interviewing the company just as much as they are interviewing you.  Sure, you want to get the job, but you also want it to be a good fit for you.  If only we can remember that when we go on an interview!  Thanks for the great info!LizDavid Livermore 5 years ago from Bakersfield, California, United StatesThat is a good response.  I'll have to remember that at my next interview!  Thanks!Jennifer Vasquez 5 years ago from Long Beach, CAHelpful tips, and some I hadn't thought of.  I have also heard that another way to respond to a question you don't know how to answer is to respond with,"That's a good question," as a way to gain yourself a few more seconds to think of something.  These tips will come in handy for me in the near future!David Livermore 5 years ago from Bakersfield, California, United StatesI agree with most of these.  However the interviews I went on didn't ask about the organization at all.  Mostly my skills, how I would handle scenarios, etc.  Problem with interviews is that you never know what they will ask!havingmysay 5 years ago from USAWhat I have discovered in my interviews is that the potential employer will ask questions related to a "weakness" you may have or a conflict you have had on a job.  The best way to respond is to answer the question by giving an example of an instance that has occurred and then state how you rectified the problem/conflict or how you have made efforts to turn you "weakness" into a strength.In addition, it is always helpful to research the company you are interviewing with.  Employers always ask a question or two that will let them know just how much energy you have placed into finding out about their organization.  Research the company you are interviewing with is also a great way to come back with a substantially intelligent question when they ask, "Do you have any questions for me?"Milan Padariya 5 years ago from AhmedabadVery nice and Informative...Thanks to share with us..Really good....Copyright © 2019 HubPages Inc. and respective owners.

They went above and beyond our expectations.A properly working heating system is crucial to the efficiency and comfort of your home. At Halco our experts know exactly how important it is to have a heating system that won’t cost more money than necessary and will keep your home comfortable. If you have an older heating system that may not be running properly the short-term issue is that your home is not as comfortable as it could be. The long-term issue is that you are losing money. If you are struggling with a boiler or furnace that is old or not working properly, updating it will save you money on your energy bill.Halco does not only do heating system installation, we are also industry leaders when it comes to heating system repairs. Our team of professionals understands exactly what it takes to keep your heating system running smoothly and your family warm. We have the expert crews and technicians to make long-lasting heating system repairs, including boilers and furnaces. Always remember to contact a professional if you notice any problem with your heating system. Postponing maintenance can make things worse and cause further issues down the road and create more heating system repairs.Many homeowners are under the impression that their home is properly insulated. However, when we take a look we find that the majority of homes do not have the proper amount of insulation. We find the wrong types of insulation used, insulation in the wrong locations, gaps in the insulation and in some cases no insulation at all. What does that all mean? It means you are spending far more money than necessary to keep your home comfortable. Stop wasting money, contact the professions at Halco today!The idea of home insulation has been around for centuries. Cavemen lived in caves because of the natural protection it afforded them. Modern dwellings do not naturally keep the inhabitants warm and comfortable, insulation must be added to get the job done. Pink fiberglass insulation was used for decades but now Polyurethane spray foam is the best product available. By adding additional attic insulation, you will make your home more comfortable and save money on your energy bills. We all know that heat rises and as a result attic insulation can have a major impact on the efficiency of your home. When you are heating your home in the colder months that heat will rise and escape through your attic. Depending on the size of your home the amount of heat that will escape could be equivalent to keeping a window open. In a national study, the average R-value found in an average attic is R-19 while the U.S. Department of Energy recommends an R-value between R-49 and R-60. Halco has the trained professionals who will be able to give you certainty about the attic insulation in your home and its overall efficiency. Call or click today to Save up to 20% or more in heating and cooling costs with a properly insulated attic!Halco is a full-service plumbing company that can handle any of your plumbing repair and installation needs.

All Rights ReservedSite by Rareview Lets start with Coal. In the coming Paper, the current coal-euphoria has been scrutinised and a couple of issues are worth a mention. Primo: it was found necessary to emphasize the difference between coking coal (metallurgical) and thermal coal both in terms of values and of markets. This is crucial in various ways because, although not always explicitly referred to, what the mining companies (hereinafter designated by extractors) are primarily looking for in the Tete Basin is Coking Coal and not really the Thermal one. Hence, in order to reach a plausible 2020-forecast for the Tete coal basin, and its induced significance on the Indian Oceans seaborne trade, a critical review has been made on the marketing potential offered by the quality of these two types of Tetes coal and, in particular, on their linkage with the Coke Connection and the mineral trinity (iron ore, coking coal and nickel) that drive their well established dominance of the global maritime trade in a world characterized by the trilogy population-urbanization-motorization. One of the products of this research is a matrix of coal flows in 2020. This matrix, although quite conservative if compared to the wide range of publicly announced disparate figures, suggests at least a duplication of the number of large dry-bulk carriers navigating the Channel of Mozambique as a result of the exponential growth of coal exports  63 MTPA, excluding new transits from RSA, Botswana and Zimbabwe. This coal-matrix also evidences the rather geo-dispersed nature of eventual maritime flows from the coast of Mozambique and the managerial potency required by their underpinning continental corridors. Implicitly, the matrix anticipates an eventual degree of technical sophistication that unequivocally points to the urgency of investing smartly on maritime promptness from now on  particularly in Mozambique that, nowadays, handles less than 14 MTPA of dry-bulks and 1,227 recorded vessel annual calls.Energy and Mining Corridors 2020Good Morning...

It's not about the home business, nor about what you are doing as much as who you are being.  Be true to the real you, the brilliant, spectacular, talented and remarkable you, and guess what?Your business will skyrocket.Posted September 19th, 2006 by WendyCategories: Success Thinking,  Productivity,  Overcoming ObstaclesThe first post in this series:
The Business Boxing Match :: Success vs. FailureThe second post in this series: Fight the Inner Battle :: Sneaky Tools to WinThe third post in this series:Go to the Mattresses :: Overcoming Obstacles vs. Untapped PotentialThe fourth post in this series:Claim the Victory :: Embrace your Success This upcoming weekend I am gearing up to be a trainer at the sales seminar that saved my life. Iâm super-duper excited. In honor of this, and the critical material we cover in the live event, Iâm going to do a series of posts this week on Values Conflicts.Huh? Values conflicts? Yes - they are the single biggest destroyer of small business. Values conflicts are responsible for creating the obstacles we must overcome to succeed. Allow me to explain:We all have good values we hold in high esteem. For most of my readers, I can guess at several of them: Family time. Success. Love. Growth. Connection. Comfort. Freedom. Achievement.
We also have values that we would do just about anything to avoid. Rejection. Fear. Anger. Frustration. Humiliation. Self Doubt. Unworthiness. Lack of Control. Guilt. Iâll call these avoidance values.Values conflicts arise when we percieive a risk of feeling one of our avoidance values in order to move towards one of our good values. Hereâs the important part - we may not even be conscious of the perceived risk. Allow me to give you an example:I had a friend that was preparing herself to be a Small Business Coach. She found an opportunity to be mentored by someone with extensive credentials, and who also offered to help her build her coaching business. She is the kind of person that would be an extraordinary coach - focused, experienced, well-read, and very influential and admired in her local community.But she hated to sell.In fact, it wasnât just a hatred - it was a downright replusion of the whole idea. Mention sales to her, and she could only think of a used car salesperson with a hard-close rehearsed and at the ready.
Not surprisingly, her coaching practice wasnât doing very well. As a business owner, whenever she had an opportunity to âpitchâ her business, she said the right things, but her voice was timid. And her body language was completely incongruent with the words coming out of her mouth. She would state that she is a great coach that got results. But she sounded like she was a timid mouse, and she would even physically recoil as she spoke.My friend had values of success, contribution, and hard work. She was enthusiastic and likable.  She also had a ton of guts, determination, and a willingness to go the distance to make her business a success. Not to mention talent - loads of talent.But she had one teensy weensy avoidance value - rejection.There is one rule that I want you to remember when it comes to values. So important Iâm going to shout it out in all caps and bold letters:WE WILL ALWAYS DO MORE TO AVOID PAIN
THAN WE WILL TO ATTAIN PLEASURE.My friend had all of the right ingredients for success - she already posessed everything she needed to make it BIG as a coach. But because she had to risk rejection in order to grow her business, she consistently acted in ways that did NOT support her business, sabotaging her own success. Every week she took one step forward and two steps back. And she was suffering emotionally, financially and even physically because of it.~This is just one example of how an avoidance value can destroy a business. If you can see even a little bit of yourself in this picture, if you hear a little whisper of recognition, then return all week for some daily insights and even some action items into managing values conflicts :: for your self and for your business.As momtrepreneurs, solopreneurs, and even dadtrepreneurs, working at home usually means that we donât have someone else to hold us accountable for our decisions and actions. Because of this, we donât have someone who can objectively review our business actions and call us on our own bull$#it when we choose to act on an avoidance value instead of a good one.Think itâs easy to spot in your business? Probably not. But hereâs a start:Action item for today :: List out your top 6 good values (the things you love to feel) and your top 6 avoidance values (the things you hate to feel).The next post in this series is Fight the Inner Battle :: Sneaky Tools to WinTags: Values, Conflicts, Values Conflicts, Professional Development, Personal Development, Self Help, Business Failure, Self Sabotage, Success, Success Thinking, Overcoming Obstacles, Work at Home, Self Employment, Productivity, Focus, Home Business, Home Based Business, What do you think?

  audit;  Province's clean-energy bill would 

  raise hydro rates, promote alternative power and create 50,000 jobsThe Toronto Star: Rob Ferguson - 

  February 24, 2009 Ontario residents won't be able to 

  sell their houses or condos without first getting a home energy audit - which 

  now costs about $300 - under the proposed new Green Energy Act.That's one of several measures in 

  the legislation unveiled by Energy Minister George Smitherman to boost incentives 

  for electricity conservation and encourage renewable sources of energy.The legislation was applauded by 

  environmentalists as ambitious, although the David Suzuki Foundation says its 

  green intent is undermined by government plans to build a new nuclear power 

  plant at Darlington.But critics fear the energy audits 

  and Smitherman's estimated 1 per cent rise in household electricity bills as 

  a result of the law will pinch pocketbooks as the recession deepens."It'll be used to beat down 

  the seller of a home," Progressive Conservative MPP and energy critic John 

  Yakabuski warned of the audit, which would put detailed information on a home's 

  energy efficiency into the hands of buyers.Toronto homeowners are already concerned 

  about the impact the city's new land transfer tax - in addition to the provincial 

  one - is having on sales and prices. Both taxes add up to thousands of dollars 

  even on cheaper houses.As for higher electricity prices, 

  Smitherman promised measures to help low- income families but said anyone thinking 

  prices will fall is mistaken as governments around the world try to curb greenhouse 

  gases that cause global warming."Most people expect that electricity 

  prices will be going up," he told a news conference, adding that there 

  are incentives and government aid under the act to help homeowners improve their 

  energy conservation efforts.While homeowners will have to get 

  a private contractor to do an energy audit before selling, there will be no 

  requirement to take any action - the measure is simply intended to inform potential 

  buyers what state of energy efficiency a property is in so they can take action 

  if desired.But New Democrat MPP and energy critic 

  Peter Tabuns (Toronto-Danforth) said the act - which will also update the provincial 

  building code to require new buildings to be more efficient and require higher 

  efficiency standards for appliances - just doesn't go far enough."What we've seen today is still 

  too timid compared to what we need in Ontario," Tabuns said, citing as 

  an example that Portugal now requires solar systems in new houses.The higher cost on electricity bills 

  - and many of the 50,000 jobs that the government claims the act will create 

  over three years - will stem initially from a $5 billion investment to improve 

  the electricity transmission and distribution grid.Smitherman's plan is to modernize 

  it so homeowners, for example, can put solar panels on their rooftops and sell 

  any excess power they don't need back into the system at a price yet to be determined, 

  making the grid a "two-way street."Utilities such as Toronto Hydro will 

  undertake that work under ministerial directives to be issued soon, Smitherman 

  said.Government programs, still in the 

  developmental stages, would provide low- interest or no-interest loans to help 

  homeowners pay for the solar, thermal, ground source heat pumps and micro-wind 

  energy systems that will be promoted under the act, which still requires a vote 

  of the Legislature this spring."There will be strong incentive 

  for people to be small-scale energy producers," Smitherman said. "The 

  vision here is thousands and thousands and thousands of Ontarians into the game."The question is will Ontarians be 

  able to afford it, said Yakabuski, who noted there won't be any details for 

  months on how much financial aid citizens can expect or how much they'll be 

  paid for any electricity they provide the grid."They've got to put a lot of 

  meat on these bones," said Rick Smith of Environmental Defence, who nevertheless 

  hailed the Green Energy Act as a way to slow the pace of global warming and 

  help attract "billions of dollars in (green) investment ..."Smitherman's prediction of 50,000 

  jobs is also fuelled by provisions in the act to require Ontario-made content 

  in green energy projects, such as steel in wind turbines that could come from 

  mills in Hamilton or Sault Ste. Marie.No content level has yet been set 

  but it will be over 25 per cent, government officials suggested."It's going to be able to put 

  people back to work," said Ken Neumann, director of the United Steelworkers 

  union in Canada.Smitherman said the home energy audits 

  will help create "green" jobs for auditors, with plans to phase the 

  requirement in over a longer period because there are not enough contractors 

  in the auditing business to meet demand.As for wind turbine projects, like 

  the controversial proposal for one in Lake Ontario off the Scarborough Bluffs, 

  standards for setbacks from property will be set in the coming months by the 

  environment ministry.Smitherman said the distance currently 

  envisioned is 500 metres - further than some existing wind turbine projects 

  are from homes - but that the legislation would not be retroactive, so no turbines 

  now in place would have to be moved.

        Tribal Government
Window Rock, Arizona is the Navajo Nation capital. Since
        1989, the Navajo Nation has governed itself using a three-branch system
        of government: 

 The Executive Branch is headed by the President and Vice President.
Elected
officials
serve a four-year term by the popular vote of the Navajo people. 

 The Judicial Branch is headed by the Chief Justice of the Navajo Nation,
is appointed
by the President, and is confirmed by the Navajo Nation Council. 

 The Legislative Branch is comprised of 88 members called council delegates
or
the Navajo Nation Council. Legislators serve a four-year term and are elected
by the registered voters of all 110 chapters, the smallest administrative units
of the Navajo Nation. 

      Navajo Nation Flag

On
        May 21, 1968, the Navajo Nation Council adopted this flag, designed by
        Jay R. Degroat, a Navajo from Mariano Lake, New Mexico and selected from
      140 entries.(more)
        Navajo Tribal Seal
On
        January 18, 1852, the Navajo Nation council adopted the great seal, designed
        by John Claw, Jr. of Many Farms, Arizona. The 50 arrowheads outlining
        the seal symbolize the tribe's protection within the 50 states. The opening
        at the top of the three concentric lines is the east; the lines represent
        a rainbow and the sovereignty of the Navajo Nation.(more)

        Local Governance
        Local governance occurs through entities called “Chapters,” which
        are geographically subdivided populations of tribal members. Each of
        the Navajo Nation’s 110 chapters is centered near a population
        center. 

        The Local Governance Act enables tribal members to vote on local economic
        development issues, such as the granting of home and business site leases
        within the community. Though chapters have significant power in the community
        with planning and development, the ultimate authority legally remains
        in the hands of the Navajo Nation Council.

During 2011, 7,450 million cubic metres of gas were distributed, a decrease of 503 million cubic metres, or 6.3%, compared to 2010, mainly due to the milder temperatures recorded during the year.At 31 December 2011, Snam had concessions for gas distribution services in 1,449 municipalities (1,448 at 31 December 2010), of which 1,330 were in operation and 119 had to complete and/or create the networks. It had 5.897 million active meters at gas redelivery points to end users (households, businesses, etc.), compared with 5.848 million at 31 December 2010.As at 31 December 2011, the gas distribution network covered 50,301 kilometres (50,307 kilometres at 31 December 2010). The slight reduction of six kilometres is due to the balance between the increases and decreases in the network. The increases are primarily due to:Compare the key figuresof the past years.

Haberer Insurance recommends that all businesses have general liability coverage in place.Errors & Omissions (E&O) covers professionals for negligence and errors or omissions that injure their clients or cause damage to a third partyâs data. This type of insurance is particularly important to licensed professionals such as accountants, attorneys, insurance agents, architects, engineers and technology companies. Haberer Insurance recommends that all professional and technology companies have E&O coverage.Employment Practices Liability Insurance for employers covers employment-related liabilities other than on-the-job injuries. This can include legal fees and damages for suits such as wrongful termination, discrimination, sexual harassment, and other alleged violations of employeesâ legal rights. If you have employees, Haberer Insurance recommends considering this type of coverage.D&O insurance covers directors and officers of a company for negligent acts or omissions and for misleading statements that result in lawsuits against the company. There is a variety of Directors and Officers coverage available such as corporate reimbursement coverage, personal liability, and entity coverage. D&O policies may be broadened to include coverage for employment practices liability as well.To find out more about these, as well as other business insurance products and services, call us and weâll help make sure youâre properly covered.Spring Cleaning Tips – Spring is a time for new beginnings, and cleaning and organization around the house are very popular this...   more »Home  |  About  |  Contact  |  Service  |  Mortgages  |  Privacy  |  Disclaimer  |  Search © 2019 Haberer Insurance Agency 5041 Hickory BlvdHickory, NC 28601

Les tribunaux de commerce sont soumis aux dispositions communes Ã  toutes les juridictions. Ils relÃ¨vent des mÃªmes valeurs dÃ©ontologiques que celles applicables aux magistrats et rendent leurs dÃ©cisions au nom du peuple franÃ§ais.
Mais la justice commerciale comporte des spÃ©cificitÃ©s tenant Ã  la nature du mandat de ses juges : ils sont Ã©lus, bÃ©nÃ©voles et peuvent exercer concomitamment une activitÃ© commerciale ou industrielle. Nous venons tous de l'entreprise. Nous la connaissons, c'est notre force, nous en sommes proches, c'est notre risque. Paradoxalement, en valorisant notre expÃ©rience professionnelle et notre connaissance des milieux Ã©conomiques, nous nous exposons Ã  des contraintes dÃ©ontologiques plus fortes que d'autres.
Il est pour cela devenu plus indispensable que jamais de prÃ©venir toute situation potentiellement constitutive de conflits d'intÃ©rÃªts au sein de nos tribunaux. Cette exigence d'impartialitÃ© fait l'objet de dispositions lÃ©gales particuliÃ¨res dans le domaine des entreprises en difficultÃ©. Dans tous les autres cas, elle se manifeste dÃ¨s l'audience : les juges du commerce doivent s'interdire de traiter l'affaire d'une personne ou d'une sociÃ©tÃ© avec lesquelles ils sont en relation directement ou indirectement ou avec laquelle ils sont en concurrence. A aucun moment ne peut Ã©merger une opinion favorable ou non Ã  l'une des parties Ã  l'affaire, pas mÃªme lors de la rÃ©daction des jugements.
Mais cette rigueur doit s'imposer au-delÃ . Les comportements ou les propos des juges en dehors de leurs tribunaux doivent Ãªtre exemplaires afin de ne pas obÃ©rer l'image d'impartialitÃ© qui est attendue de leur fonction. Aucune interfÃ©rence ne doit Ãªtre tolÃ©rÃ©e avec des engagements pris Ã  titre privÃ©, associatifs, philosophiques, qui seraient de nature Ã  influencer l'activitÃ© juridictionnelle.
L'exigence d'impartialitÃ© est donc trÃ¨s large et, en pratique, le juge doit s'abstenir de participer Ã  toute formation de jugement pour prÃ©venir toute situation constitutive de conflit d'intÃ©rÃªts. Il doit, selon la terminologie juridique, se Â« dÃ©porter Â». C'est le cas lorsqu'existent des relations rÃ©guliÃ¨res avec une des parties ou un lien Ã©conomique isolÃ© mais significatif et rÃ©cent. La dÃ©tention directe ou indirecte d'une partie au capital de l'entreprise en difficultÃ©, fÃ»t-elle marginale, constitue aussi une cause d'abstention. Tout comme d'Ã©ventuelles nÃ©gociations engagÃ©es au prÃ©alable qui, relevant d'une relation personnalisÃ©e avec le dÃ©biteur, doit conduire le juge Ã  s'abstenir.
Nous disposons, depuis longtemps, d'un code de dÃ©ontologie et d'une commission des sanctions qui condamne le manquement Ã  ces obligations. Nous attendons aussi avec impatience la publication par la chancellerie du Recueil des obligations dÃ©ontologiques sur lequel nous avons longuement travaillÃ© ces derniÃ¨res annÃ©es. L'objectif recherchÃ© dans le projet de rÃ©forme sur la justice du XXIe siÃ¨cle prÃ©sentÃ© par la garde des Sceaux consiste Ã  inscrire dans le Code de commerce, Ã  l'instar des magistrats professionnels, les obligations dÃ©ontologiques du juge du tribunal de commerce. Pour la ConfÃ©rence gÃ©nÃ©rale des juges consulaires de France (CGJCF), qui fait de cette question l'une de ses prioritÃ©s, il est important de s'inscrire dans une dÃ©marche plus large de diffusion de la culture dÃ©ontologique. Celle-ci doit s'appuyer sur la mise en place au sein de chaque tribunal d'une veille dÃ©ontologique avec un juge rÃ©fÃ©rent qui, avec le prÃ©sident, constitue un vecteur important pour irriguer cette culture. Cette dÃ©marche volontariste, qui est celle de la CGJCF avec l'appui souhaitÃ© des services compÃ©tents de la chancellerie, est - nul ne peut en douter - partagÃ©e par les 3.200 juges consulaires de notre pays.

150 mÃ¨tres carrÃ©s ultra-sÃ©curisÃ©s Ã  Elancourt, dans les Yvelines. Les portables restent Ã  l'entrÃ©e ; seules les personnes habilitÃ©es par le ministÃ¨re de la DÃ©fense peuvent travailler dans la salle de contrÃ´le d'Airbus Cybersecurity. Une vingtaine de professionnels surveillent, jour et nuit, les rÃ©seaux des entreprises qui ont confiÃ© leur sÃ©curitÃ© informatique Ã  cette filiale du groupe Airbus. PrÃ©cieux, Ã  l'heure oÃ¹ un piratage colossal de donnÃ©es confidentielles - 57 millions de comptes hackÃ©s - vient d'Ã©clabousser Uber, aprÃ¨s Yahoo (3 milliards de donnÃ©es piratÃ©es), la chaÃ®ne de supermarchÃ©s Target (100 millions de donnÃ©es clients), l'organisme de crÃ©dit Equifax (145 millions) et bien d'autres vicimes de cyberattaques de moindre ampleur mais tout aussi prÃ©judiciables.Â Â 
A l'aide de sondes placÃ©es aux endroits stratÃ©giques des rÃ©seaux informatiques des entreprises, le SOC -Â  le nom du centre opÃ©rationnel d'Airbus Cybersecurity - dÃ©tecte la moindre anomalie.Â  Ransomware, dÃ©ni de service, sabotage , etc., Â toutes les infractions sont traquÃ©es Ã  distance. Les sondes font remonter en temps rÃ©el l'Ã©tat du trafic jusqu'Ã  Elancourt. Les informations, anonymisÃ©es lors de la visite des Â« Echos Executives Â», sont modÃ©lisÃ©es sur les Ã©crans de la salle de contrÃ´le.Â Â«Â Lorsqu'une intrusion est dÃ©tectÃ©e, nous informons tout de suite le client. Â», explique FrÃ©dÃ©ric Julhes, directeur gÃ©nÃ©ral d'Airbus Cybersecurity.Â Â« L'action suivante consiste Ã  tracer l'attaque, puis Ã  la sÃ©curiser Â». La fine connaissance des attaquants est un enjeu majeur dans la lutte contre la cybersÃ©curitÃ©. Chez Airbus, 135 groupes de pirates informatiques sont dans le viseur. Leur typologie est large.Â Â«Â Cela va du groupe terroriste au mercenaire qui dÃ©robe des donnÃ©es pour les revendre Ã  des entreprises industrielles, en passant par le groupe d'activistes de type Anonymous Â», prÃ©cise le dirigeant.Â Â«Â  L'enjeu est de circonscrire l'attaque sans l'arrÃªter, afin de comprendre d'oÃ¹ elle vient, d'amÃ©liorer notre connaissance des pirates et d'anticiper les prochaines attaques.Â Â»
CrÃ©Ã© en 2012, le SOC surveille actuellement les rÃ©seaux de trente clients, parmi lesquelsÂ  des opÃ©rateurs d'importance vitale, les fameux OIV . Le prix de cette prestation comprend, d'une part, la mise en place des sondes et leur paramÃ©trage qui demandent trois Ã  six mois dans le cadre d'une grande entreprise et, d'autre part, des prestations de surveillance. Soit environ un million d'euros pour la premiÃ¨re partie, plus un service contractualisÃ© de surveillance, sur trois Ã  cinq ans, d'environ 200.000Â euros par an.
L'annÃ©e 2017 a Ã©tÃ© dominÃ©e par des attaquesÂ  de type ransomware, Â logiciel malveillant qui prend en otage les donnÃ©es personnelles. L'annÃ©e 2018 s'annonce sous les mÃªmes auspices. A ceci prÃ¨s, que le dÃ©veloppement des objets connectÃ©s (IoT) dans l'industrie vient fragiliser la forteresse informatique. Selon le directeur d'Airbus Cybersecurity, l'intelligence artificielle sera un outil prÃ©cieux pour analyser le flux de donnÃ©es qui Ã©manent des entreprises.Tous droits réservés - Les Echos 2019

عالمنا
فقدت الليرة التركية نحو 40% من قيمتها أمام الدولار منذ بداية العام وحتى الآن. هذا الانهيار الشديد دفع عددًا من وكالات الائتمان الدولية والخبراء الاقتصاديين إلى التحذير من أزمة اقتصادية كاملة في تركيا. هذا الانهيار الشديد يؤثر في الاقتصاد التركي الذي يشهد منذ 2016 أزمة اقتصادية حادة، تسببت في ارتفاع معدلات التضخم إلى 15% على أساس سنوي، وهو المعدل الأعلى منذ الأزمة الاقتصادية الأخيرة التي عاشتها تركيا في بداية الألفية الثالثة. تعيش الليرة حالة من الانهيار أمام الدولار بداية من 2012، حين سجل الدولار متوسط 1.7 ليرة. أما الآن، فالدولار يقارب 6.5 ليرة، ما يعني أن الدولار تضاعف نحو أربع مرات أمام الليرة في آخر ست سنوات فقط.يعكس هذا الانخفاض المستمر أزمة عميقة في الاقتصاد التركي نفسه، ويطرح للدول النامية مثالًا جيدًا حول مدى فعالية واستدامة هذا النموذج الاقتصادي والتنموي، والذي يعتمد بالأساس على الاقتراض لتمويل النمو. أيضًا يطرح هذا الموضوع سؤالًا آخر حول تصاعد السلطوية في النظام التركي، ومدى تأثير ذلك في الاقتصاد. تبدو أزمة الاقتصاد التركي الحالية شبيهة، إلى حد بعيد، بأزمة النمور الآسيوية أواخر القرن العشرين، والتي اندفعت أيضًا بتأثير عجز الميزان التجاري، ما أنتج أزمة كبيرة في سوق العملة، وانخفضت قيمة عملات هذه البلدان أمام الدولار بشدة.كمعظم الاقتصادات الناشئة، يعاني الاقتصاد التركي من غياب اليقين حول مستقبله وارتباطه بآفاق المستقبل العالمي.تركيا التي شهدت خلال العشرين عامًا الأخيرة قفزة اقتصادية مدفوعة بالاقتراض شديد الكثافة، والذي موَّل النمو الاقتصادي، ورفع معدلات التشغيل، وبخاصة في قطاعات البنية التحتية التي غيَّرت من الوجه العمراني لتركيا خلال تلك الفترة. لم تكن تلك معجزة اقتصادية كبيرة على عكس ما يروج بعضهم،

 فدائمًا تمتلك الاقتصادات الناشئة، مثل الاقتصاد التركي، إمكانيات كبيرة لتحقيق معدل نمو مرتفع، خصوصًا إذا كانت الدولة تمتلك سوقًا محلية كبيرة جدًّا بحجم تركيا التى يقارب سكانها الثمانين مليونًا. فمن المتوقَّع أن يزيد الناتج المحلي بنسب كبيرة، مدفوعًا بشدة بزيادة الطلب الاستهلاكي المحلي الذي يعمل بدوره على تشغيل الدورة الاقتصادية بشكل أكثر كفاءة. هذا ما كان كينز سوف يقوله الآن إذا كان بيننا.خلال تلك الحقبة، روَّج الاقتصاد التركي نفسه باعتباره اقتصادًا ناشئًا ذا إمكانات كبيرة، وبخاصة في قطاع الصناعات التحويلية (الملابس بالأساس)، وساعد على نمو هذا القطاع أن العمالة التركية أرخص مقارنة بجيرانها الأوروبيين، ومهارتها مقبولة جدًّا مقارنة بأجورها. لذلك يمكن أن يرتفع الطلب العالمي عليها، ما دفع المستثمرين المحليين والأجانب إلى ضخ كثير من الأموال في سوق الصناعات التحويلية التركية. أيضًا في القطاع العقاري، والذي يبدو أقل من حيث القيمة المضافة، وأقل تأثيرًا في الميزان التجاري للدولة التركية، ضخت أنقرة كثيرًا من الاستثمارات، لكن جاءت تلك الاستثمارات المباشرة مع قرينتها غير المباشرة، وأيضًا الاقتراض المفرط للشركات التركية الكبرى، وبخاصة من البنوك الأوروبية. كمعظم الاقتصادات الناشئة، يعاني الاقتصاد التركي من غياب اليقين حول مستقبله وارتباطه بآفاق المستقبل العالمي. مثلًا تؤثر أسعار النفط بشدة في معدل التضخم في تركيا لأنها دولة مستوردة للطاقة. وحتى لو كانت حالة انعدام اليقين تلك مدفوعة بالتغيرات السياسية الداخلية، كما حدث في محاولة انقلاب 2016، فإنها تؤثر وبشدة في عقلية المستثمرين في السوق التركية. كذلك أثرت الحرب التجارية مع الولايات المتحدة بشدة في الوضع الاقتصادي التركي، وبدأت الحرب التجارية للرئيس ترامب بفرضه رسومًا جمركية على بضائع صينية، تصل قيمتها إلى 34 مليار دولار، لاحقًا أعلن ترامب الحرب على جميع الأطراف: أوروبا وكندا، وحتى تركيا. شكَّل وصول ترامب إلى السلطة في 2017 صدمة كبيرة للعالم الذي وجد نفسة أمام شخص من خارج أجندة السياسية التقليدية، يدفع بخطاب معادٍ للعولمة، على عكس المتوقَّع، ويركز على الداخل الأمريكي. من الممكن القول إن الثمار الحقيقية للعولمة جنتها الدول النامية والاقتصادات الناشئة. ورغم اختلال التجارب التنموية في تلك الدول على مستوى توزيع أرباح النشاط الاقتصادي، وحتى انخفاض القيمة المضافة في الاقتصادات ككل، لاعتماد هذه الدول على الصناعات التحويلية بشكل رئيسي (المنسوجات في حالة تركيا مثلًا، والإلكترونيات في حالة النمور الآسيوية)، ومن ثَم اعتمادها على استيراد مدخلات الإنتاج من الخارج. تركيا أيضًا تعتمد في اقتصادها الإنتاجي على هذا القطاع بشكل كبير، وحتى في صادراتها. لذلك، حينما يعمد الأمريكيون الخروج من هذا الإجماع الاقتصادي حول العولمة،

 ويعهدون إلى فرض تعريفات جمركية على بضائع تلك الدول الناشئة، فمن المؤكد أن تلك الدول ستتأثر، وبشدة.ما أجج الأزمة العميقة التي يعيشها الاقتصاد التركي منذ 2012، الخصومة السياسية مع الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية بعد احتجاز تركيا الجبري للقس الأمريكي «أندرو برونسون». ورغم أن الاقتصاد التركي سجل معدلات نمو جيدة، تخطت 7% في السنتين الأخيرتين، فإنها لم تكن كافية لمنع الأزمة الحالية.لم يكن ترامب يريد سببًا ليخوض حرب «الجميع ضد الجميع» التي يشنها من أجل أن يجعل أمريكا «عظيمة» مرة أخرى. لكن جاء القس الأمريكي منحة من السماء ليستمر في حربه ضد تركيا. «أندرو برونسون»، وهو قس أمريكي يدير كنيسة صغيرة في تركيا، اعتقلته السلطات التركية، ووجهت إليه اتهامات بالتعاون مع حركة الخدمة، وزعيمها فتح الله كولن، الذي تتهمه الحكومة التركية بالتخطيط لانقلاب 2016. من تداعيات هذا الموقع، جمدت الحكومة الأمريكية أصولًا تعود إلى وزيري العدل والداخلية في حكومة أردوغان، قبل أن تعود بعدها بأيام قليلة، ويصرح «ويبلر روس»، وزير التجارة الأمريكية، بأن الولايات المتحدة ستضاعف من التعاريف الجمركية على البضائع التركية التي تستوردها. لاحقًا دعا أردوغان مواطنيه إلى مقاطعة البضائع الأمريكية ردًّا على العقوبات الأمريكية على بلاده. أيضًا نشرت الجريدة الرسمية التركية قرارًا بفرض رسوم جمركية، تصل إلى 140% على البضائع الأمريكية، منها السيارات والكحول والتبغ. يميل التبادل التجاري بين البلدين لصالح الولايات المتحدة التي تصدر لتركيا أكثر مما تستورد، ومن ثَم، سيتأثر الاقتصاد التركي. هنا ليس الحديث فقط عن الأثر الاقتصادي المباشر، لكن عن الأثر الأكثر خطرًا، وهو ثقة المستثمرين في بلد لا يتمتع اقتصاده بقوة كافية ليشكل اقتصادًا مستقرًّا على المدى الطويل. لذلك سيحجب هذا جزءًا من الاستثمارات الأجنبية المباشرة.على المستوى الداخلي تُضخم الحكومة التركية كثيرًا من هذه الحرب التجارية. فمنذ الانقلاب العسكري في 2016، يحاول أردوغان إقناع شعبه بألا يشتري الدولار أو اليورو، وأن يحتفظ بالليرة التي تقل قيمتها يومًا بعد الآخر،

 وأن الأتراك لن ينجوا من أزمة العملة إلا بتضامنهم.وفي السياق نفسه، أعلنت قطر عن نيتها القيام باستثمار مباشر في تركيا بقيمة 15 مليار دولار، فيما يبدو كمساندة لتركيا في أزمتها، ومحاولة لوقف الهبوط السريع للاقتصاد التركي.لكن في العموم، تبدو الخطابات التركية الشعبوية مفرطة في الثقة، ولا تدرك أن الأزمة بالفعل أكبر من مجرد من حرب الولايات المتحدة التجارية على العالم، وأن الأمر يتخطى هذا إلى النموذج الذي تبناه أردوغان نفسه في النمو الاقتصادي، والذي يعتمد في الجزء الأكبر من تمويله على اقتراض الحكومة والقطاع الخاص لتوفير فرص العمل والحفاظ على معدلات البطالة في أقل مستوياتها من أجل الانتخابات.مع عدم استقرار البنية الاقتصادية بشكل كامل، وعدم وجود سياسات تراقب السوق بشكل فعال، تكون الدولة في مهب الرياح.تعاني تركيا من عجز في ميزان تجارتها الخارجية. فوارداتها أكثر من صادراتها، والعجز يجب أن يُموَّل، إما من استثمارات أجنبية، وإما بالاستدانة. ولا يعد هذا بحد ذاته غريبًا أو خطيرًا، لكن العجز لدى تركيا أصبح كبيرًا جدًّا ليبلغ 5.5% من إجمالي الناتج المحلي 2017. هذا العجز لا يعكس فقط أن حجم صادرات الاقتصاد التركي من السلع والخدمات أقل من حجم وارداته، لكنه كذلك (بالتدقيق في هيكل العجز) يعكس مدى التشوه الذي أصاب الاقتصاد التركي،

 التشوه المتمثل في الاستثمارات الأجنبية غير المباشرة في الأوراق المالية، وبخاصة أدوات الدين قصير الأجل في تركيا. الدولة النامية أو الاقتصاد الناشئ، في العالم الذي يبحث فيه كبار المستثمرين عن الربح لا غيره، لن يمكنهما أن يجلبا فقط الاستثمار الأجنبي المباشر، أي في القطاعات الإنتاجية في الاقتصاد، والتي تسهم في توظيف مزيد من العمالة وتقليل معدلات البطالة ورفع المستويات المعيشية لغالبية السكان، وهو ما حدث في التجربة التركية جزئيًّا. لكن بجانب هذا، يأتي الأثر الجانبي. فالدولة الناشئة تقترض كثيرًا من السوق العالمية، لدرجة أن تصل ديونك الخارجية إلى 453 مليار دولار، أي ما يقارب نصف الناتج المحلي الإجمالي. حينها لا بد من أن تقع هذه الدولة في فخ الأموال الساخنة، وهي الاستثمارات غير المباشرة، بالذات في أدوات الدين قصيرة الأجل والأسهم، والتي سرعان ما تتبخر وتحلق نحو دولة أخرى في ظل أي تهديد أو عدم استقرار. ومع عدم استقرار البنية الاقتصادية بشكل كامل، وعدم وجود سياسات أو تشريعات تراقب هذه السوق بشكل فعال، فالدولة إذًا في مهب الرياح. في 1998، كتب خبراء صندوق النقد تعليقًا على أزمة النمور الأسيوية، إذ استنتجوا أن المشكلة كانت في عدة محاور، أهمها غياب الرقابة على سوق أدوات الدَّين في إطار سعي تلك الدول للحصول على معدلات نمو مرتفعة وقدرة تشغيلية كبيرة للاقتصاد. يرى خبراء الصندوق الذين روجوا في تسعينيات القرن العشرين لنموذج واحد من العولمة الليبرالية متمثلًا في سياسات تحرير سعر الصرف، وفتح الأسواق أمام حركة رؤوس الأموال، أن كثيرًا من الاستدانة يسهم في عدم استقرار هياكل الاقتصاد الداخلية في الدولة، ولذلك يطرح إمكانية حدوث أزمة كبيرة. أيضًا يرى هؤلاء أن دول جنوب شرق آسيا كانت بحاجة لمزيد من التشريعات الاقتصادية التي تضع في الاعتبار جذب الاستثمار الأجنبي، لكن بضوابط معينة، منها الحفاظ على استقرار أسعار الفائدة. في أزمة دول جنوب شرق آسيا، أسهمت أسعار الفائدة المنخفضة في هروب كثير من المستثمرين الأجانب نحو بلدان أخرى، مثل الولايات المتحدة واليابان، والذين بدورهم رفعوا أسعار الفائدة أكثر. هنا يتحدد، في نموذج النمو بالاستدانة، مدى قدرة الدولة النامية على تحمل التنافسية في أسعار الفائدة مع الدول الكبرى التي تبدو ذات هياكل اقتصادية أكثر ثباتًا وقادرة على تأمين احتياجاتها التمويلية بشكل أكثر استدامة. هذا بالضبط ما حدث مع تركيا. الفيل في الغرفة كما يقال، وهذا الفيل كان الدَّين، وحين أحس مستثمرو الأموال الساخنة بأن هيكل الاقتصاد التركي هش،

 رغم معدلات النمو المرتفعة، وبدأوا سحب أموالهم الساخنة نحو مناطق أخرى في العالم تتمتع بأسعار فائدة أعلى، انخفضت الليرة مقابل الدولار. يصر أردوغان على التدخل في سياسات البنك المركزي التركي، فالرجل لديه رؤية اقتصادية تبدو صحيحة نظريًّا، وهي أن الإبقاء على معدلات فائدة منخفضة سيشجع الاستثمار المحلي، بما يمكن أن يسهم، على المدى الطويل، في تعديل هيكل الاقتصاد نفسه، بالاعتماد على الاستثمار المحلي. حالة نجحت الصين في تحقيقها خلال عقدي ثمانينيات القرن العشرين وتسعينياته، وهو المحافظة على معدل ادخار عالٍ، واستثمار محلي مرتفع في قطاعات إنتاجية تساعد على التشغيل والتصدير. لكن تلك الاستشرافية طويلة الأمد لا تصلح في الوقت الحالي، ما دفع البنك المركزي التركي أخيرًا إلى رفع أسعار الفائدة بنسبة 3%، على أمل أن يبطئ من هروب الأموال الساخنة، فيتوقف نزيف الليرة أمام الدولار.أردوغان يرى أن أسعار الفائدة، وبحسب تصريح سابق له، هي «أم الشرور». يمكنني في سياق آخر أن أتفق معه، لكن في الوقت الحالي، والذي يعتمد فيه النموذج التركي بشكل كبير على الاقتراض من أجل النمو، لا يصلح هذا. ففي النهاية يقع الاقتصاد التركي بأكمله تحت سكين الاستثمار الأجنبي.يمكننا تلخيص الأزمة التركية الحالية بأنها الإفراط في العولمة النيوليبرالية، وليست فقط الإفراط في الاقتراض.الإفراط في الاقتراض يمكنه تقريبًا تفسير الأزمة التركية الحالية، وبخاصة أنها ليست فقط أزمة الدين الحكومي الخارجي، لكنها كذلك أزمة الشركات والبنوك التركية التي ترتبط بشكل كبير بمنظومة الاستدانة تلك. فهي تمتلك ما يقرب من نصف الديون الخارجية، ولذلك في تلك المرحلة يقع الاقتصاد كله في فخ الدَّين، وأي تخلف عن السداد من الممكن أن يزيد من قلق المستثمرين والبنوك الأجنبية التي يمكن أن تتخلف، في أي لحظة، عن إقراضك مزيدًا من الأموال. يرى كثير من المحللين أن الأزمة الحالية لليرة التركية بسبب الاقتراض الزائد عن الحد. لكن «مايكل روبرتس»، الاقتصادي الإنجليزي، يرى أن الأمر لا يبدو فقط أزمة سياسات مالية أو نقدية خاطئة للحكومة التركية، إذ يتخطى ذلك إلى وضع أكثر صعوبة، فرفع الولايات المتحدة أسعار الفائدة قد يضر كثيرًا بالاقتصادات الناشئة في العالم.تكمن مشكلة النموذج الاقتصادي التركي في أنه دائمًا على حافة الانهيار، بسبب اعتماده على الاستدانة الخارجية لتمويل النمو.

 لكنها ليست مشكلة الأتراك وحدهم، فالعالم المعولَم بالكامل، والذي يضمن تدفقًا سهلًا وحركة أكبر لرؤوس الأموال، أخذ ينهار في ظل تراجع الولايات المتحدة، المروِّج الأول للعولمة، عن تلك السياسة، وعلى الجميع الآن أن يدفع هذا الثمن. بعد مرور ما يقرب من ثلاثة عقود من العولمة النيوليبرالية، وعقد واحد من أزمة اقتصادية كبيرة عاشها العالم في 2008، ما زالت جميع الحكومات تدفع الثمن الباهظ لغياب الرقابة على الأسواق، على المستوى القومي، وغياب الرقابة على حركة رؤوس الأموال، على المستوى العالمي. يمكننا إذًا أن نلخص أزمة تركيا الحالية بأنها الإفراط في العولمة النيوليبرالية، وليست فقط الإفراط في الاقتراض. الشعبوية قد تجعلك تكسب الانتخابات، لكنها من الممكن أن تخيف المستثمرين أيضًا.تدخَّل أردوغان كثيرًا فى أعمال البنك المركزي التركي، الذي يبدو مستقلًّا فقط على الورق، لكن من الإجحاف أن نقول إن هذا هو السبب المباشر للأزمة، فالأمر له علاقة أكثر بهيكل الاقتصاد. أيضًا كان مبرر الولايات المتحدة في حربها التجارية ضد تركيا سببًا سياسيًّا عندما احتجزت تركيا القس الأمريكي، لكن هذا أيضًا في نظري ليس سببًا مباشرًا للأزمة، وإن أسهم في ظهورها وتضخيمها إعلاميًّا في الفترة الأخيرة.إذًا، ما السياسة التي أتحدث عنها؟ تعاني النظم التي ما زالت لم تنجز مرحلة التحول الديمقراطي بشكل كامل، وما زالت العلاقات المدنية العسكرية فيها ضبابية بشكل كبير، من تشوه في الهيكل الاقتصادي

 أولًا على مستوى القاعدة الاقتصادية التي تعاني من معدلات فساد ومحسوبية بسبب غياب الشفافية بشكل كبير. أيضًا خضع الاقتصاد التركي والسياسات الاقتصادية لأجندات العدالة والتنمية الانتخابية التي تسعى إلى إرضاء الناخب التركي الذي أصبح لا يقبل بمستوى معيشي أقل مما وصل إليه في العقدين الأخيرين. بينما يواجه حزب «العدالة والتنمية» انخفاضًا في شعبيته بسبب تراجع المكاسب الاقتصادية للمواطنين الأتراك، وخصوصًا في الحواضر الريفية التي تمثل القاعدة الانتخابية الأكبر للحزب الذي يسعى، عبر تبني خطابات شعبوية، إلى الحفاظ على ما تبقى له.الشعبوية قد تجعلك تكسب الانتخابات، لكنها من الممكن أن تخيف المستثمرين أيضًا. في الفترة الأخيرة، وبعد الانقلاب تحديدًا، تبنَّى العدالة والتنمية خطابًا عدائيًّا ضد جميع الأطراف، وبخاصة الأوربيين والأمريكيين الذين وجد فيهم أردوغان شمَّاعة جاهزة ليعلق عليها كل هذا الفشل الاقتصادي في الأونة الأخيرة. أيضًا، وعلى مستوى السياسة الخارجية، يقلل أردوغان من فرص الدعم الإقليمي له، سواء من ممالك الخليج (عدا قطر)، والتي كان يمكن أن تقرضه كثيرًا من الأموال، ليحل أزمة العملة الحالية التي يعاني منها. هذا مثلًا حدث مع باكستان سابقًا حين لجأت إلى السعودية في أزمة مماثلة.يمكننا القول إن السياسات الاقتصادية التركية أسهمت في التشوه الذي يعاني من عواقبه الاقتصاد التركي الآن، السياسات المتركزة بشكل أساسي حول الاقتراض من أجل تمويل النمو، ويبدو أن هذا سيستمر على المدى القريب، لكن بطريقة أكثر رشدًا، بعد أن تلجأ الحكومة التركية إلى المؤسسات الدولية من أجل خطة إنقاذ، إذا استمرت الأزمة الحالية في التفاقم.نشر في 2018/08/15

Heating and domestic hot water needs will be satisfied by an innovative energy solution: Hythane(1), a new gas composed of hydrogen and natural gas. The aim of the project is to demonstrate the technical, economic, environmental and social advantages of this new energy solution for sustainable cities and green mobility in real operating situations.The project was launched in 2014. The first two years were devoted to a phase of technical and sociological studies, followed by a five-year demonstration phase of two uses of hydrogen injection: transport and housing.The French government is supporting the GRHYD hydrogen energy storage demonstrator project now being conducted by ENGIE and a consortium of industrial partners(2). France has set the target of meeting 23% of its gross end-user energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020. This ambitious project aims to convert surplus energy generated from renewable sources into hydrogen, which will then be blended with natural gas for a broad range of applications, including space heating, water heating and fuel. As a result, generators of energy from intermittent renewable sources, such as wind and solar power, will have a new solution for marketing the electricity they generate, at the same time as reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Development of hydrogen in this way delivers a direct response to a series of energy and environmental challengesâ¦ Power to gas : The GRHYD demonstrator makes it possible to valorize the ENR (green electricity not finding an outlet on the electricity network) in the form of hydrogen gas distributed in the natural gas network, by implementing the Power-to-Gas concept. To evaluate the technical, economic and environmental relevance of Power-to-Gas, two demonstrators for this new energy solution are now up-and-running as part of a project involving local authorities and local residents in the Dunkerque Urban Community: The results of a simulation of the gas and hydrogen needs of the first 100 homes made it possible to determine what hydrogen installations would be required for electrolysis, storage and injection, and which models.The proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer can produce up to 10 normal cubic meters of hydrogen per hour. The storage module has a capacity of 5 kg. The hydrogen is stored thanks to a technological innovation, in the form of metal hydrides.The electrolyzer and storage technology have been tested in real operating situations to meet the energy demands of neighborhood residents.Hydrogen converted back into gaseous form can be injected into the natural gas network to constitute a new fuel. The demonstration starts with the injection of the first molecules of hydrogen into the distribution network to supply homes in the new neighborhood.The quantity of hydrogen mixed with the natural gas will vary depending on the availability of green electricity while remaining below 20% in volume in order to respect safety regulations.Partners in the GRHYD project inaugurate Franceâs first Power-to-Gas demonstrator (1) Fuel composed of hydrogen and natural gas.(2) Twelve industrial partners are taking part in the GRHYD demonstration project alongside ENGIE. Companies include GrDF, GNVERT, AREVA Hydrogen and Energy Storage, CEA, McPhy Energy, INERIS, CETIAT and CETH2."Power to gas" : an innovative solutionJavaScript seem to be disabled in your browser.You must have JavaScript enabled in your browser to utilize the functionality of this website.USER PORTALThe review system is a way for customers of this business to easily share their opinion.

company ID number 556302-9726, hereby submit the annual accounts

and consolidated financial statements for the 2011/2012 financial

year.The year's good development of both sales and earnings is a

combination of sound organic growth and implemented acquisitions,

which developed well in the Group.On the whole, demand was good for our operations during the

first half of the year. Organic growth was also healthy during the

second half, despite several customers being more cautious in their

order forecasts. Demand in our product and market areas continued

to develop positively.The market is more fragmented than in the past and we are seeing

substantial variations between different geographic markets,

customer segments and product niches. Demand from Nordic healthcare

was stable at a high level throughout the financial year. In the

market for production components for Nordic manufacturing

companies, a certain degree of restraint towards the end of the

year mostly affected the Group's operations in Sweden and Denmark.

The Group's companies in Norway, Finland and markets outside the

Nordics continued to perform well.The business has developed extensively in recent years, partly

thanks to the increase in contacts and cooperation between the

Group's subsidiaries. In parallel, a large number of newly acquired

companies have been added, which also contributed to the need for

change in our operations and offering. As a result of these

developments we implemented a small-scale reorganisation in the

Group, effective as of 1 April 2012. The reorganisation comprised

moving a number of companies between our four business areas and

creating two new business units. The reorganisation did not affect

the Life Science business area. See also Note 5 Segment reporting.

As of the first quarter of the 2012/2013 financial year, reporting

for the Group will be according to this new structure.To sum up, the 2011/2012 financial year was a positive year for

growth in both sales and earnings. The year was characterised by

good organic growth and several successful acquisitions that have

developed well in the Group. All business areas strengthened their

positions in various markets and reported a positive earnings

trend, but the market is more fragmented than in the past.Financially speaking, the Group's position was robust during the

year, maintaining a high equity ratio and a low net debt/equity

ratio. We have surpassed, and have also increased, our

profitability goal for P/WC. As a result, the Group generated

strong cash flow from operations during the year, which has been

used for investments in existing operations and acquisitions of new

companies. The Group is thereby very well-equipped for further

expansion of its business. The focus in several areas during the year was to implement

acquisitions and invest in existing operations to enhance the

Group's market position in selected segments and niches. The Group

is very well-equipped for further expansion of its business.phone +46-8-4704900ï»¿

Disputes - International: stretching over 250,000 km, the world's 325 international land boundaries separate 195 independent states and 71 dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, and other miscellaneous entities; ethnicity, culture, race, religion, and language have divided states into separate political entities as much as history, physical terrain, political fiat, or conquest, resulting in sometimes arbitrary and imposed boundaries; most maritime states have claimed limits that include territorial seas and exclusive economic zones; overlapping limits due to adjacent or opposite coasts create the potential for 430 bilateral maritime boundaries of which 209 have agreements that include contiguous and non-contiguous segments; boundary, borderland/resource, and territorial disputes vary in intensity from managed or dormant to violent or militarized; undemarcated, indefinite, porous, and unmanaged boundaries tend to encourage illegal cross-border activities, uncontrolled migration, and confrontation; territorial disputes may evolve from historical and/or cultural claims, or they may be brought on by resource competition; ethnic and cultural clashes continue to be responsible for much of the territorial fragmentation and internal displacement of the estimated 20.8 million people and cross-border displacements of approximately 12.1 million refugees and asylum seekers around the world as of mid-2013; over half a million refugees were repatriated during 2012; other sources of contention include access to water and mineral (especially hydrocarbon) resources, fisheries, and arable land; armed conflict prevails not so much between the uniformed armed forces of independent states as between stateless armed entities that detract from the sustenance and welfare of local populations, leaving the community of nations to cope with resultant refugees, hunger, disease, impoverishment, and environmental degradationRefugees And Internally Displaced Persons: the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated that as of the end of 2012 there were 45.2 million people forcibly displaced worldwide; this includes 15.4 million refugees, 937,000 asylum seekers, and 28.8 million conflict IDPs (another 32.4 million IDPs were displaced by natural disasters); the UNHCR estimates there are currently 10-12 million stateless persons (2012)Trafficking In Persons: current situation: approximately 800,000 people, mostly women and children, are trafficked annually across national borders, not including the millions who are trafficked within their own countries; at least 80% of the victims are female and up to 50% are minors; 75% of all victims are trafficked into commercial sexual exploitation; almost two-thirds of the global victims are trafficked intra-regionally within East Asia and the Pacific (260,000 to 280,000 people) and Europe and Eurasia (170,000 to 210,000 people) (2012) ; Tier 2 Watch List: (44 countries) Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Bahrain, Belarus, Belize, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Myanmar, Burundi, Cambodia, China, Comoros, Cyprus, Djibouti, Guinea, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Kenya, Laos, Lebanon, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mali, Marshall Islands, Morocco, Namibia, Pakistan, Panama, Qatar, Rwanda, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Solomon Islands, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, Tanzania, Timor-Leste, Tunisia, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uruguay ; Tier 3: (23 countries) Algeria, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Cuba, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Iran, North Korea, Kuwait, Libya, Malaysia, Mauritania, Papua New Guinea, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Thailand, Uzbekistan, Yemen, Venezuela, Zimbabwe (2014)Illicit Drugs: cocaine: worldwide coca leaf cultivation in 2007 amounted to 232,500 hectares; Colombia produced slightly more than two-thirds of the worldwide crop, followed by Peru and Bolivia; potential pure cocaine production decreased 7% to 865 metric tons in 2007; Colombia conducts an aggressive coca eradication campaign, but both Peruvian and Bolivian Governments are hesitant to eradicate coca in key growing areas; 551 metric tons of export-quality cocaine (85% pure) is documented to have been seized or destroyed in 2005; US consumption of export quality cocaine is estimated to have been in excess of 380 metric tons ; opiates: worldwide illicit opium poppy cultivation continued to increase in 2007, with a potential opium production of 8,400 metric tons, reaching the highest levels recorded since estimates began in mid-1980s; Afghanistan is world's primary opium producer, accounting for 95% of the global supply; Southeast Asia - responsible for 9% of global opium - saw marginal increases in production; Latin America produced 1% of global opium, but most was refined into heroin destined for the US market; if all potential opium was processed into pure heroin, the potential global production would be 1,000 metric tons of heroin in 2007Copyright Â© Economywatch.com. All Rights ReservedSite by RareviewOne of the most common types of business insurance is commercial property insurance, which provides a wide range of coverage for buildings, inventory, equipment, tools and more. Losses from fire, break-in, vandalism, wind and other natural or manmade disasters are examples of what is typically covered.A basic commercial property insurance policy may be all you need, although the types of coverage can vary between different insurance companies. As an independent insurance agent, Family Trust can help you determine the type of insurance policy and range of coverage that is best for your business.For a full list of coverage available, or to learn more about this business property insurance, contact us today.Do you own a commercial building? If so, do you have enough commercial property insurance to cover replacement costs? Although cost estimators are available, we recommend that you secure an appraisal from a third party to accurately determine the current replacement cost of your building. Give us a call today, and weâll help you determine if you have enough commercial property insurance for your business.Most commercial property policies exclude flood as a covered cause of loss. A separate policy must be purchased to protect you from resulting damage. Check your current property insurance policy to be sure you are covered. If youâre unsure, just ask us to review your insurance policy, and weâll help you find the best solution.Business personal property insurance covers property at a specified location such as furniture, fixtures, equipment and inventory. Be aware that most commercial property policies have very limited coverage for property taken off the specified location. If you have equipment that is frequently taken off-site to various locations, it is important that you have an inland marine policy (equipment or installation floater).This coverage reimburses a business owner for lost profits and fixed expenses during the time that a business is closed. It applies while the premises are being restored because of damage from an event such as a fire. Business income insurance may also cover financial losses that occur if civil authorities limit customer access to your neighborhood or business after a disaster. We strongly recommend that all businesses acquire this coverage.This coverage is separate property coverage specifically designed to protect your computer related equipment. Most commercial property policies have limited coverage for computer networks. EDP broadens the causes of loss to include things like power surges and in some cases virus attacks.Family Trust understands the Las Vegas business insurance needs of our customers. The right coverage for you is unique â call us today to find out how to protect your business and your future with the right insurance.

      Signup            On Nov. 17, Christopher Rodway, 48, a
          British citizen working in a Saudi hospital, died after a small
          explosion in the capital tore through his car, which was believed to
          have been booby-trapped. Rodway's wife was slightly injured. On Nov.
          22, a bomb exploded in another car in Riyadh, wounding two men and a
          woman, all British workers at an unidentified company.``The source of the explosives and
          many other relevant facts are known to us, but in the interest of the
          investigation we will not disclose them now,'' Prince Nayef said in a
          statement on state-run Saudi television. He did not say when the three
          were arrested.He also said nine others had been
          arrested ``in connection with other crimes, and they are still under
          investigation.'' He did not reveal their nationalities, except to say
          none were Saudis. The statement was vague and it was not clear if
          those arrests were connected to the case of the three Westerners.Prince Nayef said diplomats from the
          three countries have visited the men in custody.A Canadian Foreign Affairs ministry
          spokesman, Oussamah Tamim, said the Canadian, William Sampson, 42, has
          been in custody in Saudi Arabia since November and that consular
          officials visited with him as recently as last week. He said they
          tried to provide them with assistance earlier but were denied
          permission by Saudi authorities.A British Foreign Office spokeswoman
          said Sunday night that she was aware of the broadcast but could not
          confirm whether any of the details were true.``We are currently seeking official
          confirmation of what was alleged,'' she said on condition of
          anonymity.A Belgian foreign ministry spokesman
          declined to comment, saying Belgium does not release the names of
          nationals accused or arrested abroad.Following Prince Nayef's
          announcement, the three men appeared on state-run Saudi television and
          confessed to the bombings. On a street map, they pointed out the
          location of the victims' homes and the blast sites.All three men spoke in English, with
          a voice-over in Arabic. Their names were translated from Arabic, and
          except in Sampson's case, the spellings could not be immediately
          confirmed.The first man identified himself as
          Alexander Mitchell, of Britain. He said that he had received
          instructions to carry out the Nov. 17 bombing with the help of
          Sampson. He did not say who gave the order for the bombing.Mitchell said he planted the
          explosive device on Rodway's car, then that the two men followed the
          victim and his wife to a main thoroughfare where Sampson detonated the
          explosive by remote control.Sampson, who said he worked as a
          marketing consultant, said he was ordered by Mitchell to make
          preparations for the second bombing with the help of a Belgian he
          identified as Raf Schifter.Schifter said he was at Mitchell's
          home and heard a conversation between Mitchell and Sampson about the
          first explosion.Later, Mitchell told him he would
          need his help in the second bombing, Schifter added. He said he
          received an explosive device from Sampson which he was ordered to
          plant on a car parked near his car outside a residential complex. He
          said he followed the car and saw it explode.``I immediately stopped my car behind
          it and helped the wounded people,'' he said. ``What I have said is the
          truth.''

Thursday, June 14, 2007 at 11:15pm by Site AdministratorThe First American Entrepreneur?
Mark Skousen of The Daily Reckoning has a great retrospective of Benjamin Franklin and his positive influence in helping make the US a country of wealth and wealth-mindedness. Note that Skousen has “updated Franklin’s Autobiography for modern times.”Personally, I think of Franklin as a consummate entrepreneur and inventor – a role model to be emulated. I’ve read his Autobiography and a number of other biographies about him, at the same time that I was studying my two other favorite inventors, Thomas Edison and Leonardo da Vinci. Franklin, in addition to being an entrepreneur, was also a diplomat and put in a public effort to educate people.The Entrepreneurial Spirit
Richard Stratton, a British entrepreneur, graduated from business school last year, but became bed-bound recently when he dislocated a hip. But he didn’t let that stop him, and taught himself web design. He ended up creating a website that helps promote other sites at a low cost, while rotating their positioning. While it’s a fairly new site and has only attracted 57 companies/ advertisers, it’s sort of similar in concept to sites like Million Dollar. In other words, it has potential to do well. [via PR Leap]Oprah: Most Powerful Celebrity
While I was watching the news tonight, one clip declared talk show Oprah as the most powerful American celebrity. She earned about US$260M last year. The next closest earner was Tiger Woods, who made less than half that amount. Oprah for President! Why not? She’s probably more qualified and popular than some of the other candidates, and very entrepreneurial besides.

Quotes 
from

Tao 

		Te Ching

The 

		Tao  "The Way"
⃝  The 

		Tao 

			principle is what happens of itself.

		⃝ 

			The Tao is told is not the Tao.

		⃝ 

			The Tao never acts with force, yet there is nothing that it can not 

			do.

		⃝ 

			The great Way is easy, yet people prefer the side paths. Be aware 

			when things are out of

			


balance. Stay centered 

			within the Tao.

		⃝ 

			As it acts in the world, the Tao is like the bending of a bow. The 

			top is bent downward; the bottom is bent up. It adjusts excess and 

			deficiency so that there is perfect

			balance.

		⃝  Tao loves and nourishes all things, but does not dominate it 

			over them.

		⃝ 

			When good thing are accomplished, it does not claim (or name) them. 

			This is 
Te, which is 

			close in meaning to power or virtue. It 

			is something within a person, and it is enhanced by following the

			Tao, or 'that from which nothing can deviate'.

		⃝ 

			When Simplicity is broken up, it is made into instruments. Evolved 

			individuals who employ them, are made into 

		leaders. In this way, the 

			Great System is United.



Living the Tao
 
⃝ 

		Intelligent people know others.

			Enlightened 

			people know themselves.
⃝  The Master observes the world, but trusts his inner vision. He 

			allows things to come and go. His heart is as open as the sky.
⃝  
⃝  Can you 

		step back 

			from your own mind and thus 

			understand all things?

		⃝ 

			When I let go of what I am, I become what I might be.

		⃝ 

		I have just three things to teach: 

			simplicity, patience, 

			compassion. These three are 

			your greatest treasures.

		⃝ 

			No disaster is worse than being 

			discontented.
⃝  

Success is as dangerous as 

			

failure, and we are often our own worst 

			enemy. 
⃝  The journey of 1,000 miles starts with a single step.
⃝  Confront the difficult while it is still easy; 

			accomplish the great task by a series of small acts.
⃝  
When 

			you have accomplished your goal simply walk away. This is the path 

			way to Heaven
⃝  

Love the whole 

			world as if it were your self; then you will truly care for all 

			things. 
⃝  A sage is skilled at

			helping people without excluding anyone.
⃝  
The 

			Master doesn't seek fulfillment. For only those who are not full are 

			able to be used which brings the feeling of completeness.

		⃝ 

			Allow your softer, more 

			intuitive, and less dominating feminine qualities to rise to 

			the fore, so that you're surrendering rather than dominating, 

			receiving rather than broadcasting, loving rather than fighting.
⃝  
That 

			which offers no resistance, overcomes the hardest substances. That which offers no resistance can enter where there is no space.

			Few in the world can comprehend the teaching without words, or understand the value of non-action.
⃝  Can you love or guide someone without any kind of expectation?

		⃝ 

			Nurture the spontaneous peaceful life.

		⃝ 

			Don't impose your will through manipulation of aggressive emotions 

			and actions

		⃝ 

			If you worry more for others' beliefs, then you will be their slave.
⃝  
There is no greater transgression than condoning peoples selfish 

			desires, no greater disaster than being discontent, and no greater 

			retribution than for greed. 
⃝  Rule your mind with serenity rather than with force and 

			manipulation.

		⃝ 

			Approach your own inner life with a

			loving quality that accepts who you are without trying to change 

			who you are.

		⃝ 

			Having reached a high level of realization (or having accomplished 

			anything in life), don't get excited or puffed up with pride but 

			remain calm, humble, and in "perfect equanimity" if you want to 

			continue in this deep state of consciousness.  

		
About Lao Tzu
Lao 

	Tzu was born in app. 500 BC, in southern China in the state of Ch'u, now 

	known as the Hunan Province. Almost nothing is known about Lao Tzu apart 

	from what can be gleaned from the legends that surround his name. His book 

	of spiritual reflections called the Tao Te Ching (The Way 

	 Virtue  Progress) has been 

	published in more languages than any book except the Bible.1
For at least fifty years, Lao Tzu worked in the 

	emperor's library, kept mostly to himself, and was considered a recluse and 

	a mystic of deep wisdom. To our knowledge, all during his long tenure at the 

	Imperial Archives Lao Tzu wrote no books, nor did he allow any disciples to 

	gather around him. 
Lao Tzu 

	and Confucius




→


Confucius, the venerable philosopher who was born a generation after 

	Lao Tzu, once sought out Lao Tzu for an interview, during which Lao Tzu told 

	the soon-to-be-famous philosopher and moralist: "Strip yourself of your 

	proud airs and numerous desires, your complacent demeanor and excessive 

	ambitions. They won't do you any good. This is all I have to say you." 

	Following this now-famous interview with the old man, young 

	Confucius said 

	to his disciples, "I don't know how dragons can ride upon the wind and 

	clouds and soar to high heaven. I saw Lao Tzu today. He can be likened to a 

	dragon."1
Life 

	Style
Lao Tzu lived a simple contemplative life in 

	which he learned step by step by step how to practice what he understood to 

	be "the Way" or "the Path"  or in Chinese, the

	

	Tao. Throughout his life, "he walked his walk but didn't much talk 

	any talk."1
  




Those who 

			know don't talk, 


those who talk don't know.

According to Henry Way2, "Lao Tzu 

	may rightly be regarded as an immortal inspirer. His teachings constitute a 

	bright beacon for the guidance of the human spirit to supreme fulfillment... 

	He led a long, quiet and studious life and then vanished from the human 

	scene, leaving behind a compact parcel of sublime wisdom in glorious 

	poetry... He was not exactly a hermit or recluse, but simply loved the 

	contemplative life. He preferred to stay in obscurity in the silence of the 

	library, devoting himself to inner culture and the pursuit of truth, living 

	with serene spontaneity and natural ease."2   
  



Embrace 

			simplicity. Put others first. Desire little.



Lao Tzu
         

	
 
The Book Tao Te Chin
Lao Tzu wrote his only book Tao Te Ching 

	just before he walked away from the Chou empire he served. One day the old 

	man decided to take his leave of the city and simply started walking towards 

	the distant mountain pass. "Arriving at the gate leading out of the Chou 

	empire, he was halted by the keeper of the border, a man named Yin Hsi, who 

	asked him, "Before you retire entirely from the world, will you please write 

	some words for our enlightenment?" Lao Tzu obviously agreed, because before 

	he walked out through the gates and disappeared into anther kingdom and 

	who-knows-what personal life experience, he left with Yin Hsi a slender 

	collection of eighty-one short poems and reflections, consisting in total of 

	only around five thousand words."1
  




If you can 

			find true contentment, 

			

it will last forever.

Health maintenance organizations (HMO) delimit patient access to primary care by member-physicians, while with preferred provider organizations (PPO), such exclusivity does not exist.

By Scott Kirsner, Globe ColumnistI was told by an individual close to the deal that the purchase price was roughly $135 million in cash, and that's what other outlets have been reporting today. (The company had raised about $20 million in venture capital since being founded as uLocate in 2004.) Where Inc. executives say that the company will maintain an office in Boston, and will likely add to its current employee count of 120. Doyle says the company grew from 30 employees to 120 over the past 18 months.Where Inc. had originally tried to sell a service that would enable family members to get information about one another's location using their mobile devices; more recently, it has been focused on operating an advertising network that reaches mobile phone users, and promoting its own mobile app to help consumers find relevant businesses around them (and also potentially delivering discounts.) Doyle is the company's third CEO."This is a very strategic acquisition by eBay," says Charley Lax, managing partner at Grand Banks Capital in Wellesley, which originally incubated the start-up in its offices. "This is a company that was at the dance with a lot of people over the years," Lax says, suggesting that several other players had made attempts to acquire the company. Lax told me that the $135 million purchase figure was wrong, but he wouldn't say whether it was high or low."We just don't disclose any terms of the deal," says eBay spokesperson Kathy Chui.PayPal executive Amanda Pines explained the acquisition this way in a blog post this morning:Where CEO Doyle says that the company will be focused going forward on using its mobile app to "drive foot traffic to merchants," and presumably using PayPal to consummate transactions. "It's about frictionless and contextual commerce for the consumer," Doyle says. He says he'll remain in Boston, rather than moving to PayPal's San Jose headquarters: "This is all about Boston. I lived out west for eight years. I did my Valley time."Boston has seen a string of five major mobile acquisitions over the past few years, Doyle notes, including Apple buying Quattro Wireless for $275 million and VeriSign buying m-Qube for $250 million. "Boston is a tremendous hub for mobile development," Doyle says. (I'd ask: is "hub" the right term, or "shopping mall for big tech players"?)Here's PayPal's blog post on the deal, along with coverage from Mass High Tech, TechCrunch, and BostInnovation.eBay's most recent prior purchase in the Boston area took place in 2003, when the company bought the assets of the publicly-traded auction site FairMarket for $4.5 million in cash; that company's Web site no longer exists, and the phone number no longer works. eBay also picked up Boston-based "flash sale" site Rue La La last month, as part of an acquisition of GSI Commerce, but eBay plans to spin that company out again.

The company gave an assurance in this regard to a delegation of Tamil Nadu officials, which visited China last week, according to a senior government official.The delegation was led by Tamil Nadu deputy chief minister M K Stalin. The state government had earlier said that it was expecting investments to the tune of around RsÂ  3,000 crore (Rs 30 billion) from China and Korea in the next two years, which would generate around 10,000 direct and indirect jobs. Speaking to Business Standard on the sidelines of TPM national conference, organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry, state industries secretary Rajeev Ranjan said, "We have met the management (of Huawei) and they confirmed that they propose to invest in the state to set up a telecom equipment manufacturing facility."Skills training programmeRanjan said that the state government had taken up an integrated skills development scheme aimed at providing training to over 100,000 people in the next six months. The government has identified 15 sectors like (mainly sub sectors of manufacturing), leather, automotive and chemical."The government has allocated RsÂ  50 crore for the programme, which will be taken up as a pilot. We will extend our support by giving RsÂ  6,000 per person," Ranjan said.The training would be provided through government institutions like power loom and weavers service centres and textiles research associations, and apparel training and design centres. Â The scheme would be implemented mostly through government agencies and the rest through private-public partnership model.Ranjan said that the state had 456 colleges and 130,000 engineering students were passing out from these colleges every year. "Whether they are employable is the issue. To fill this gap and to support the industry, we have decided to take up this programme," he added.

          sorry to say that Aardvark Business has now closed.It's 
          been a pleasure running it for over 8 years but sadly all things have 
          to come to an end. Paul, who is the person initially behind the site, 
          now has too many commitments that he no longer has the resources to 
          continue to manage the Aardvark websites.Of 
          all the Aardvark websites, Aardvark Travel was by far the most popular 
          and those of you who enjoyed engaging in the regular travel discussions

Outside of China, similar customs exist across parts of South East Asia and many other countries with a sizable ethnic Chinese population.Red envelopes are gifts presented at social and family gatherings such as weddings or holidays such as Chinese New Year. The red color of the envelope symbolizes good luck and is a symbol to ward off evil spirits. The act of requesting red packets is normally called tao hongbao (Chinese: è¨ç´å; pinyin: tÇo hÃ³ngbÄo) or yao lishi (Chinese: è¦å©æ¯; pinyin: yÃ o lÃ¬ shÃ¬), and in the south of China, lai see (Chinese: éå©æ¯; pinyin: dÃ²u lÃ¬ shÃ¬; Cantonese Yale: dau6 lai6 si6). Red envelopes are usually given out by married couples to single people, regardless of age, or by older to younger ones during holidays and festivals.Related Tags : 1Adress: No 122,XianWu Industrial Park Guanlan Street,Longhua District,Shenzhen+86-755-2908576113444159305Copyright Â© 2019 Darshan Color World Industrial(HK) Limited.All Rights Reserved.

In 2016 and 2015, acquisitions were not significant.Acquisitions of controlling interests have been accounted for under the acquisition method and have been included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of acquisition.While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, the purchase price allocation for acquisitions is preliminary for up to 12 months after the acquisition date and is subject to refinement as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information about the fair values of the assets and liabilities becomes available.On July 6, 2017, the Company acquired the shares of B&R, a worldwide provider of product- and software-based, open-architecture solutions for machine and factory automation. This acquisition closes a gap in the Company’s industrial automation portfolio and consequently the goodwill acquired represents the future benefits associated with product portfolio expansion.The aggregate preliminary allocation of the purchase consideration for business acquisitions in 2017, was as follows:(XLS:) Download Excel($ in millions)Allocated amountsWeighted-average useful life(1)The Company does not expect the goodwill recognized to be deductible for income tax purposes.(2)Primarily relates to the acquisition of B&R.Technology4347 yearsCustomer Relationships29219 yearsTrade names6510 yearsOrder backlog13 monthsIntangible assets792 Fixed assets131 Debt acquired(50) Deferred tax liabilities(255) Inventories177 Other assets and liabilities, net(21) Goodwill(1)1,337 Total consideration (net of cash acquired)(2)2,111 In 2017, the Company received proceeds (net of transaction costs and cash disposed) of $605 million, relating to divestments of consolidated businesses and recorded net gains of $252 million in “Other income (expense), net” on the sale of such businesses. These are primarily due to the divestment of the Company’s high-voltage cables and cable accessories businesses (the Cables business) in March 2017 and the divestment of the Oil & Gas EPC business in December 2017.The Company has retained certain obligations of the Cables business and thus the Company remains directly or indirectly liable for these liabilities which existed at the date of the divestment. Subsequent to the divestment, the Company recorded a loss of $94 million for changes in the amounts recorded for these obligations. In addition, the Company has provided certain performance guarantees to third parties which guarantee the performance of the buyer under existing contracts with customers as well as for certain capital expenditures of the divested business.In 2016 and 2015, there were no significant amounts recognized from divestments of consolidated businesses.On September 25, 2017, the Company announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire General Electric Company’s (GE) Industrial Solutions business, GE’s global electrification solutions business, for $2.6 billion. The Company expects to close the acquisition of GE Industrial Solutions in the first half of 2018, following the receipt of customary regulatory approvals.Business Bulletin 1999-2011Minutes of Proceedings 1999-2011Journal of Parliamentary Proceedings Sessions 1 & 2 Committees Sessions 1, 2 & 3 Annual reportsThe sections which appear in today’s Business Bulletin are in bold Section A: 		Today’s Business-	Meetings of Committees-	Meeting of the ParliamentSection B: Future Meetings of the ParliamentSection C: Future Meetings of CommitteesSection D: Oral Questions-	Questions selected for First Minister’s Question Time -	Questions selected for response by Ministers and junior Scottish Ministers at Question TimeSection E: Written Questions – new questions for written answer Section F: Motions and Amendments Section G: Bills-	New Bills introduced-	New amendments to Bills-	Members’ Bills proposalsSection H: New Documents – new documents laid before the Parliament and committee reports publishedSection I: Petitions – new public petitions Section J: Progress of Legislation – progress of Bills and subordinate legislationThis section is from the book "Handbook Of The Law Of Contracts", by Wm.

At common law, upon a woman's marriage the right to reduce her choses in action into possession is transferred to her husband, and he becomes liable jointly with her. during coverture, upon her antenuptial contracts. These rules are changed by statute in most jurisdictions.At common law, a married woman is disabled from acquiring the benefits of her antenuptial contract, because she cannot sue upon it apart from her husband, and she may lose them altogether, for they are vested conditionally in the husband, who may take them to himself by reduction into possession of the chose in action. He may also sue jointly with his wife for what is due on her contracts. Whatever is thus obtained passes absolutely to him.' If the husband does not thus reduce his wife's choses in action into his possession, they survive to her if he dies first, or pass to her representatives if she dies in his lifetime.N.

By Kate Faulkner, Managing Director at Designs on Property in For Landlords.With a new government in place, both the property industry and tenant and landlord groups and organisations will be keen to promote their ideas and thoughts about changes to the Private Rented Sector that would help the market work better for everyone involved.Earlier this year, I produced a comprehensive report on the Private Rented Sector (PRS), which looked at how the market worked from the various perspectives of an agent, a landlord and, of course, a tenant.Interestingly, my conclusion was that most of the PRS works really well. According to a government report, around 78% of landlords have just one property*, so they aren’t the ‘career’ landlords who are often accused of trying to squeeze
  every penny they can out of tenants.Most landlords just want to let a decent property at a fair rent and many hope that if the tenant is a good one, they will stay for a long time. This is great news for tenants, as one of the ways landlords always aim to keep the best tenants is by not
  increasing the rent unless they have to.Nationally, rent inflation for existing tenants in the same property is extremely low; the downside for tenants being that they often suddenly have to pay a lot more when they eventually move to another property - as will the new tenants that take on
  the existing property.In my view, the PRS needs some changes to make it better for all, but most of these are easy to implement and don’t require huge amounts of government intervention.One of the major problems is that many landlords and tenants don’t consider whether a property is legally let – or even know what the requirements are.I would like to see the government publish a clear list of 15 major checks that any landlord and tenant should make on a property. Steps have already been taken, with their ‘How to Rent’ Guide (link: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-rent).Next, although all letting agents now have to be a member of an Ombudsman, so that landlords and tenants have access to a free complaints procedure, I don’t think this is enough. No letting agent should be holding rent without Client Money Protection insurance,
  which means if something goes wrong in the business, the rent money is protected.More needs to be done to encourage landlords to keep the PRS well stocked with good-quality accommodation. Unnecessary rent controls could put people off investing in much needed rental stock, and taxation must be such
  that it motivates landlords to keep their property in good condition.One of the big frustrations for all good landlords and letting agents is that there is little enforcement of the rules and regulations – and this can lead to the ‘good guys’ losing business to rogues. We have to be able to easily
  identify at a local level which properties are privately rented and where licensing landlords won’t help, as only the good will apply! A great idea from the Residential Landlords Association was a tick box on council tax forms  that are filled in by tenants, to say a property is rented.Once local authorities can identify rented properties and agents, they can better ensure they are operating legally and do so cost effectively, or get help from other sources. For example, Shelter are planning to launch a pilot scheme
  in Dundee later this year that will support the local authority with a ‘private renting support officer’ whose job will be to help landlords ensure they’re operating legally.Secondly, from an enforcement perspective, there is little or no funding for new regulations to be promoted when they are introduced – let alone enforced. And if local authorities do fine landlords or agents, they don’t necessarily plough
  that money back into more enforcement, which would seem to be the sensible thing.So, monies need to be made available to educate and enforce existing and new letting laws.Bringing out rules and regulations one after another is increasing the cost of providing a good lettings service for landlords and agents. Both on and off-line there is a huge amount of misinformation and some of the rules, for example electrical safety,
  are ambiguous and need to be clarified.To keep up with the latest rules and regulations, mandatory CPD training is needed for all of the PRS – including lenders, insurers, housing charities/organisations and housing associations, as well as landlords and letting agents.
  And from a tenant perspective, many young people will now rent rather than buy, so adding ‘how to rent’ to the national curriculum would be really helpful to the next generation.The full report is available at Propertychecklists.co.uk  *https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/7249/2010380.pdf

Home - About Us - Contact Us - Legal & Terms of Use - Truckers' Savings Blog - Free NewsletterBy Scott Kirsner, Globe ColumnistI was told by an individual close to the deal that the purchase price was roughly $135 million in cash, and that's what other outlets have been reporting today. (The company had raised about $20 million in venture capital since being founded as uLocate in 2004.) Where Inc. executives say that the company will maintain an office in Boston, and will likely add to its current employee count of 120. Doyle says the company grew from 30 employees to 120 over the past 18 months.Where Inc. had originally tried to sell a service that would enable family members to get information about one another's location using their mobile devices; more recently, it has been focused on operating an advertising network that reaches mobile phone users, and promoting its own mobile app to help consumers find relevant businesses around them (and also potentially delivering discounts.) Doyle is the company's third CEO."This is a very strategic acquisition by eBay," says Charley Lax, managing partner at Grand Banks Capital in Wellesley, which originally incubated the start-up in its offices. "This is a company that was at the dance with a lot of people over the years," Lax says, suggesting that several other players had made attempts to acquire the company. Lax told me that the $135 million purchase figure was wrong, but he wouldn't say whether it was high or low."We just don't disclose any terms of the deal," says eBay spokesperson Kathy Chui.PayPal executive Amanda Pines explained the acquisition this way in a blog post this morning:Where CEO Doyle says that the company will be focused going forward on using its mobile app to "drive foot traffic to merchants," and presumably using PayPal to consummate transactions. "It's about frictionless and contextual commerce for the consumer," Doyle says. He says he'll remain in Boston, rather than moving to PayPal's San Jose headquarters: "This is all about Boston. I lived out west for eight years. I did my Valley time."Boston has seen a string of five major mobile acquisitions over the past few years, Doyle notes, including Apple buying Quattro Wireless for $275 million and VeriSign buying m-Qube for $250 million. "Boston is a tremendous hub for mobile development," Doyle says. (I'd ask: is "hub" the right term, or "shopping mall for big tech players"?)Here's PayPal's blog post on the deal, along with coverage from Mass High Tech, TechCrunch, and BostInnovation.eBay's most recent prior purchase in the Boston area took place in 2003, when the company bought the assets of the publicly-traded auction site FairMarket for $4.5 million in cash; that company's Web site no longer exists, and the phone number no longer works. eBay also picked up Boston-based "flash sale" site Rue La La last month, as part of an acquisition of GSI Commerce, but eBay plans to spin that company out again.

The company gave an assurance in this regard to a delegation of Tamil Nadu officials, which visited China last week, according to a senior government official.The delegation was led by Tamil Nadu deputy chief minister M K Stalin. The state government had earlier said that it was expecting investments to the tune of around RsÂ  3,000 crore (Rs 30 billion) from China and Korea in the next two years, which would generate around 10,000 direct and indirect jobs. Speaking to Business Standard on the sidelines of TPM national conference, organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry, state industries secretary Rajeev Ranjan said, "We have met the management (of Huawei) and they confirmed that they propose to invest in the state to set up a telecom equipment manufacturing facility."Skills training programmeRanjan said that the state government had taken up an integrated skills development scheme aimed at providing training to over 100,000 people in the next six months. The government has identified 15 sectors like (mainly sub sectors of manufacturing), leather, automotive and chemical."The government has allocated RsÂ  50 crore for the programme, which will be taken up as a pilot. We will extend our support by giving RsÂ  6,000 per person," Ranjan said.The training would be provided through government institutions like power loom and weavers service centres and textiles research associations, and apparel training and design centres. Â The scheme would be implemented mostly through government agencies and the rest through private-public partnership model.Ranjan said that the state had 456 colleges and 130,000 engineering students were passing out from these colleges every year. "Whether they are employable is the issue. To fill this gap and to support the industry, we have decided to take up this programme," he added. Moneywiz Live!ï»¿

Outside of China, similar customs exist across parts of South East Asia and many other countries with a sizable ethnic Chinese population.Red envelopes are gifts presented at social and family gatherings such as weddings or holidays such as Chinese New Year. The red color of the envelope symbolizes good luck and is a symbol to ward off evil spirits. The act of requesting red packets is normally called tao hongbao (Chinese: è¨ç´å; pinyin: tÇo hÃ³ngbÄo) or yao lishi (Chinese: è¦å©æ¯; pinyin: yÃ o lÃ¬ shÃ¬), and in the south of China, lai see (Chinese: éå©æ¯; pinyin: dÃ²u lÃ¬ shÃ¬; Cantonese Yale: dau6 lai6 si6). Red envelopes are usually given out by married couples to single people, regardless of age, or by older to younger ones during holidays and festivals.Related Tags : 1Adress: No 122,XianWu Industrial Park Guanlan Street,Longhua District,Shenzhen+86-755-2908576113444159305Copyright Â© 2019 Darshan Color World Industrial(HK) Limited.All Rights Reserved.

This acquisition closes a gap in the Company’s industrial automation portfolio and consequently the goodwill acquired represents the future benefits associated with product portfolio expansion.The aggregate preliminary allocation of the purchase consideration for business acquisitions in 2017, was as follows:(XLS:) Download Excel($ in millions)Allocated amountsWeighted-average useful life(1)The Company does not expect the goodwill recognized to be deductible for income tax purposes.(2)Primarily relates to the acquisition of B&R.Technology4347 yearsCustomer Relationships29219 yearsTrade names6510 yearsOrder backlog13 monthsIntangible assets792 Fixed assets131 Debt acquired(50) Deferred tax liabilities(255) Inventories177 Other assets and liabilities, net(21) Goodwill(1)1,337 Total consideration (net of cash acquired)(2)2,111 In 2017, the Company received proceeds (net of transaction costs and cash disposed) of $605 million, relating to divestments of consolidated businesses and recorded net gains of $252 million in “Other income (expense), net” on the sale of such businesses. These are primarily due to the divestment of the Company’s high-voltage cables and cable accessories businesses (the Cables business) in March 2017 and the divestment of the Oil & Gas EPC business in December 2017.The Company has retained certain obligations of the Cables business and thus the Company remains directly or indirectly liable for these liabilities which existed at the date of the divestment. Subsequent to the divestment, the Company recorded a loss of $94 million for changes in the amounts recorded for these obligations. In addition, the Company has provided certain performance guarantees to third parties which guarantee the performance of the buyer under existing contracts with customers as well as for certain capital expenditures of the divested business.In 2016 and 2015, there were no significant amounts recognized from divestments of consolidated businesses.On September 25, 2017, the Company announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire General Electric Company’s (GE) Industrial Solutions business, GE’s global electrification solutions business, for $2.6 billion. The Company expects to close the acquisition of GE Industrial Solutions in the first half of 2018, following the receipt of customary regulatory approvals.Business Bulletin 1999-2011Minutes of Proceedings 1999-2011Journal of Parliamentary Proceedings Sessions 1 & 2 Committees Sessions 1, 2 & 3 Annual reportsThe sections which appear in today’s Business Bulletin are in bold Section A: 		Today’s Business-	Meetings of Committees-	Meeting of the ParliamentSection B: Future Meetings of the ParliamentSection C: Future Meetings of CommitteesSection D: Oral Questions-	Questions selected for First Minister’s Question Time -	Questions selected for response by Ministers and junior Scottish Ministers at Question TimeSection E: Written Questions – new questions for written answer Section F: Motions and Amendments Section G: Bills-	New Bills introduced-	New amendments to Bills-	Members’ Bills proposalsSection H: New Documents – new documents laid before the Parliament and committee reports publishedSection I: Petitions – new public petitions Section J: Progress of Legislation – progress of Bills and subordinate legislationThis section is from the book "Handbook Of The Law Of Contracts", by Wm.

At common law, upon a woman's marriage the right to reduce her choses in action into possession is transferred to her husband, and he becomes liable jointly with her. during coverture, upon her antenuptial contracts. These rules are changed by statute in most jurisdictions.At common law, a married woman is disabled from acquiring the benefits of her antenuptial contract, because she cannot sue upon it apart from her husband, and she may lose them altogether, for they are vested conditionally in the husband, who may take them to himself by reduction into possession of the chose in action. He may also sue jointly with his wife for what is due on her contracts. Whatever is thus obtained passes absolutely to him.' If the husband does not thus reduce his wife's choses in action into his possession, they survive to her if he dies first, or pass to her representatives if she dies in his lifetime.N.

By Kate Faulkner, Managing Director at Designs on Property in For Landlords.With a new government in place, both the property industry and tenant and landlord groups and organisations will be keen to promote their ideas and thoughts about changes to the Private Rented Sector that would help the market work better for everyone involved.Earlier this year, I produced a comprehensive report on the Private Rented Sector (PRS), which looked at how the market worked from the various perspectives of an agent, a landlord and, of course, a tenant.Interestingly, my conclusion was that most of the PRS works really well. According to a government report, around 78% of landlords have just one property*, so they aren’t the ‘career’ landlords who are often accused of trying to squeeze
  every penny they can out of tenants.Most landlords just want to let a decent property at a fair rent and many hope that if the tenant is a good one, they will stay for a long time. This is great news for tenants, as one of the ways landlords always aim to keep the best tenants is by not
  increasing the rent unless they have to.Nationally, rent inflation for existing tenants in the same property is extremely low; the downside for tenants being that they often suddenly have to pay a lot more when they eventually move to another property - as will the new tenants that take on
  the existing property.In my view, the PRS needs some changes to make it better for all, but most of these are easy to implement and don’t require huge amounts of government intervention.One of the major problems is that many landlords and tenants don’t consider whether a property is legally let – or even know what the requirements are.I would like to see the government publish a clear list of 15 major checks that any landlord and tenant should make on a property. Steps have already been taken, with their ‘How to Rent’ Guide (link: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-rent).Next, although all letting agents now have to be a member of an Ombudsman, so that landlords and tenants have access to a free complaints procedure, I don’t think this is enough. No letting agent should be holding rent without Client Money Protection insurance,
  which means if something goes wrong in the business, the rent money is protected.More needs to be done to encourage landlords to keep the PRS well stocked with good-quality accommodation. Unnecessary rent controls could put people off investing in much needed rental stock, and taxation must be such
  that it motivates landlords to keep their property in good condition.One of the big frustrations for all good landlords and letting agents is that there is little enforcement of the rules and regulations – and this can lead to the ‘good guys’ losing business to rogues. We have to be able to easily
  identify at a local level which properties are privately rented and where licensing landlords won’t help, as only the good will apply! A great idea from the Residential Landlords Association was a tick box on council tax forms  that are filled in by tenants, to say a property is rented.Once local authorities can identify rented properties and agents, they can better ensure they are operating legally and do so cost effectively, or get help from other sources. For example, Shelter are planning to launch a pilot scheme
  in Dundee later this year that will support the local authority with a ‘private renting support officer’ whose job will be to help landlords ensure they’re operating legally.Secondly, from an enforcement perspective, there is little or no funding for new regulations to be promoted when they are introduced – let alone enforced. And if local authorities do fine landlords or agents, they don’t necessarily plough
  that money back into more enforcement, which would seem to be the sensible thing.So, monies need to be made available to educate and enforce existing and new letting laws.Bringing out rules and regulations one after another is increasing the cost of providing a good lettings service for landlords and agents. Both on and off-line there is a huge amount of misinformation and some of the rules, for example electrical safety,
  are ambiguous and need to be clarified.To keep up with the latest rules and regulations, mandatory CPD training is needed for all of the PRS – including lenders, insurers, housing charities/organisations and housing associations, as well as landlords and letting agents.
  And from a tenant perspective, many young people will now rent rather than buy, so adding ‘how to rent’ to the national curriculum would be really helpful to the next generation.The full report is available at Propertychecklists.co.uk  *https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/7249/2010380.pdf

(TSX-V: SNN) ("Sintana" or the "Company") announces that it has been notified by the Operator of the Talora Block that the Dorados-1X exploration well commenced drilling operations on July 31, 2012.The Company previously announced an agreement with Petrodorado Energy Ltd. (TSX-V: PDQ) to farm-in for an undivided 30% interest in the 58,570 acre Talora Block located in Colombia's prolific Magdalena Basin. The Talora Block, which is operated by Petrodorado, is immediately adjacent to the region's main oil and gas pipelines and only 60 kilometers west of the capital city of Bogota.  Given this close proximity to infrastructure, conversion of a discovery to a commercial well is expected to be a relatively quick process.The well, which is targeting the Cretaceous Caballos and Tetuan formations, is presently drilling ahead at a depth of 2,500 feet to a planned total depth of 9,500 feet. The Company will earn a 30% private participation interest in the well by paying 60% of the well costs, subject to a cap of US$6.5 Million (gross). Costs above the cap are to be paid proportionally by each partner based on their respective participation interests.In Peru, planning has commenced for a seismic program on Bayovar Block XXVII (Sintana â 25%), located in the Sechura Basin.  Faulkner Exploration, as operator, previously drilled the SC-4X seismic control well.  Open hole log data from the well is being incorporated into the design of the seismic shoot.  Post processing and analysis, optimum locations for subsequent wells will be selected based on this seismic. The SC 4X control well reached a TD of 5,276 feet and encountered the target reservoirs 500 feet lower than anticipated.  Open hole log evaluations identified a continuous column of rich gas shows from the 1,496 feet of gross Paleozoic section penetrated, starting at 3,780 feet.  Imagery logs depict a high density fracture system with a network of fracture intersections. The Operator reported that during testing the highly fractured target interval collapsed which prevented completion of the well. The objective of gathering open hole log data on the stratigraphic section on the block was achieved and indications of hydrocarbons at this location are considered a significant bonus.Doug Manner, CEO of Sintana commented "We are excited about commencing the Talora exploration drilling program and look forward to completing the seismic program at Bayovar. We anticipate having drilling results for the Dorados-1X well in September."

				M15 6SEdigitalenergy professional is a unique cloud based energy management system that helps organisations manage their building energy portfolio by reducing costs, resources and compliance risks.It is the only system that incorporates the entire range of tasks within an energy estate, from monitoring and targeting, right through to compliance audits and evidence trails.digitalenergy professional is a unique "one system for all" energy management software platform that can be accessed at different levels across diverse asset portfolios.Onscreen interfaces, dashboards and reports are equally accessible through desktop, laptop, tablet or mobile devices.Focus your stakeholder engagement on reducing costs, reducing carbon, whilst at the same time safeguarding your organisation against compliance legislation.Accurate data and utility bill management has long been an area of concern for energy consumers. Inaccurate invoices place a substantial cost burden on energy users yet many customers do not have the time or resource to resolve billing issues themselves.Switching suppliers can also lead to incorrect data input and consumption data is frequently estimated, with some companies having meters read as little as once a year. digitalenergy professional can be used for full invoice checking and bill validation in a pre or post payment process. Invoices are compared against a calculation of the correct charges that should have been applied according to the supply contracts currently in place and variances reported to the tolerances that you desire – allowing a small margin for error or down to the last penny! The validation cycle can be configured through an easy to use interface to check against: ·         Ownership and address validations·         Ensuring correct sites are billed.·         MPAN/MPRN and Serial Numbers·         Half Hourly Data (HHD)/meter read consistency.·         Missing invoices/meters.·         Estimated/actual meter read frequency·         The accuracy of billing dates.·         Transportation charges and reconciliations·         Triad charges and reconciliations·         All unit rates and charges (supplier contract).·         All published rates and charges (DuOS/TuOS)           : Launching September 2016·         Tax allocation (CCL and VAT) The system also has a powerful query manager to enable you to log actions taken to resolve issues with suppliers, data collectors or brokers. If you have tenants you can also take advantaged of the reporting system for automated recharging from validated data. High energy consuming public and private sector organisations have a requirement to demonstrate compliance to the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme to improve energy efficiency and cut carbon dioxide emissions.The CRC Management application will enable organisations to manage compliance throughout their CRC phases:·        Collate and calculate carbon footprint data at building level·        View carbon emissions generated by month and year·        Set and manage annual carbon reduction targets and cost savings·        Carbon and energy consumption reports·        Upload and maintain documentation for CRC evidence pack·        Analyse and compare year on year carbon footprints·        Reporting deadline timeline to manage progress through CRC phases User Benefits include:·        Saves time and resources for multisites, by managing CRC online in one system·        Instant access to reports and documentation required for CRC audit evidence packs·        Removes the risk of errors in data and time consuming paper based methods·        An efficient way to achieve year on year reduction in carbon emissionsdigitalenergy professional solves the problem of ‘lack of awareness’ evident in many organisations by allowing access to different types of user across your business. Whether it’s your accounts team needing to see invoice, supplier and cost information or a director requiring a simple but clear picture of organisational consumption and spend, there’s a meaningful view for everyone.Energy Updates sent via e-mail are also a useful tool and digitalenergy can even take this a step further by placing dashboards in high footfall areas within your business to ensure energy awareness extends to as many people as possible. Manchester Science Park

 I am an experienced psychiatrist with 40 years of very full-time practice behind me. During my training we were encouraged to undergo psychoanalysis which I did faithfully for 15 years, four times a week. Over the last 10 years family problems have caused me to seek out supportive psychological help with various therapists with substantial degrees.



		
Despite all this "treatment," it wasn't until I found Susana Sori that I really began to change. Her insights, knowledge, and warmth have helped me grow. I never even realized before the dimensions in my life that were missing until she began enlightening me. I began to understand that the challenges I was facing were there so that I could change and grow.



		
Her energy work is astounding. I have never met Susana face to face (we do our work over the telephone), but I feel that she is one of the closest people in my life. She understands me and my issues immediately and always has a new path to help me. As a psychiatrists, I have prescribed medication and traditional psychoanalytic and supportive psychotherapy to thousands of patients. What Susana does is a higher elevation of my traditional work.



		
I heartily recommend her to all souls in trouble or those who want to enlighten themselves.

Sharings resulting from First Session with Susana 

		SorÃ­I wanted to let you know that the first impression I had, once left the session with you, was an increased sense of my inner intuition about even the simplest things. For example: on my way back home from your place, instead of checking on the map or trying to remember with my mind my way back (as I would have done in the past, fearing to get lost) I followed my intuition, as if some "higher" power inside me was driving me. I can count many other examples like this!

    Thanks!

    
A. from Miami, Florida



    
Since my session with you, which gave me great awareness and clarity on my life at this time, people around me immediately began behaving differently. One quality that stands out, is that people I've known for a while, all of a sudden have really trusted me about their intimate thoughts and emotions.

    After our session, when I returned to work, one of my co-workers jokingly asked me if I had been smoking pot in the park. When I asked why she asked me that she said, 'Because you seem so happy.' The session apparently had quite an effect on me.

Sharings resulting from Individual Sessions with Susana SorÃ­



    Thank you for assisting me to 

        fulfill my dream. I really can feel the shift going on inside and just 

        more and more opportunities seem to be presenting themselves.

        S.L., Boston South Shore, MA


        My session with Susana was an experience with my true self. A lot of emotions that I carried deep inside were released and channeled properly to allow growth and regain confidence. She made me feel at home with myself since the very beginning and helped me see and confront what was stopping me to be in peace and grateful. She gives you a new beginning built upon your own strength.

    Your sessions have worked wonders on my husband. He is a new man. He is exercising almost everyday and can communicate better with our son. It is truly amazing...just thought you would like to know!

I have always found your sessions amazing, yet I now am beginning to understand why I have felt the process so much more deeply lately...You get to the root of core problems and your sessions are so powerful but in an almost gentle way...I just want to say thank you. I love "Susana style". I think that must be it, you put your whole being into it!

    Thank you so much for helping me mend my broken heart! 
S. K., Chicago, IL



    
Although I had my career in mind when signing up for the session, the result has been that my whole life has shifted. No small change, either...from nothing, to more opportunities that I can handle! Yes, it is a good thing!

    After our couple session, I somehow see my wife more clearly and thus more lovingly. I am looking forward to more experiences of this kind. Thank you! B.N., Houston, TX



    
I have been busy this past week and certainly did not have the session on my mind, yet, I found myself feeling grateful on several occasions. And, although I had to do some 'fearful' things, like speak my truth to my partner and express my feelings more, I felt I was supported and I could do them! The result has been that our love life has expanded and I feel much closer to my wife on many levels. We want to let you know that we appreciate all the wisdom, energy and love you gave us.

A huge 'thank you' for providing such a safe, nurturing and supportive environment. It has been an amazing experience!

    	
Couple in Massachusetts 

Sharings from 

        Group Sessions 'by proxy', or 

		'Long Distance' 
As my session with Susana, was done by proxy, I had no expectations I just knew that I was drawn to Susana's proxy workshop. The connection by proxy was deep and profound although non-invasive, upon reading my session report I was able to validate my experience with the experience of others in my group - I have never felt so strongly connected to what I read in the report, at the moment I am still speechless or as we say 'god-smacked' by the strength of the connection. - My session has left me with a profound sense of inner peace and personal freedom, I am looking forward to working with Susana again by proxy. Much appreciated and much love,

A raise I requested back in October has been approved, retroactive back to October; I accepted a job with more money and I am paying attention to savings/tax/retirement issues. I find it somewhat hard to believe that all these changes are really occurring during this workshop!

    	
P. P., Boston, MA



    
Many of my old patterns cleared and I have begun to feel a sense of normality that I have not felt in years. I have chosen to walk the road to financial wealth. The moment I made this choice I was invited and paid to do the work I love. A great blessing!

    H. W., Lexington, MA



    This course is remarkable. I am feeling the effects as we move along. This course taps the root of my core issues."

		
J. K., Ft. Lauderdale, FL



    
The results of the series have been splendid. I experience a greater monthly income for half the work I did before.

        
B. C., Miami FL



    
I am continually grateful that early on in this course we organized and reviewed our finances. The big shift for me is that I no longer have FEAR or JUDGMENT around this. In fact, I now have absolute FAITH. Great job, Susana. This was definitely transformative and needed all the attention we gave it. Thank you for all the attention, skill, genius and love that you gave us - immense!

There are several credit information companies (CICs), such as Transunion, Equifax, Experian and CRIF High Mark, that provide the lending institutions with an individualâs credit score and credit report. Therefore, it is important for everyone to know the following things - what is a credit report, how is a credit report made, what is a credit score, and how to check the credit score. These are important to know even if you do not want to apply for loans or credit cards today. A good credit score will ensure that you have access to loans and credit cards from banks whenever you require themFirstly, the rules ensure that any person can get their credit report and credit score from the credit agencies by visiting their websites and requesting for the same. The normal process involves logging in to the website of the concerned agency and uploading the documents required by the agency to provide the credit report. Once this is done, the documents are verified, and the report is emailed to the user in a few days, provided that the user pays the associated charges.An easier and quicker alternative is to check your credit score for free at mymoneykarma. This gives you your credit score from Equifax instantly. Additionally, you also get a completely free detailed analysis of your credit report. This is for free, and we donât charge you anything. We will also keep a track of your credit score in the long run and advise you on how to maintain a good credit score.Credit report is like a report card made by credit bureau (or Credit Information Company) that contains your credit history with all the different lenders. It is a report that provides the details of an individualâs borrowing history and repayment record; it tells the prospective lenders whether the individual is a reliable borrower. A credit report includes the following information:Hence, a credit report provides the future lenders with data points on the applicantâs creditworthiness on the basis of previous and current credit behavior. The lenders take the lending decision based on the credit report.The Credit Information Companies (CIC) collect the records of your loans and credit cards. These records are made available to these companies by the banks and lenders on a regular basis as mandated by RBI. Based on this data, the CIC runs its algorithms to provide a credit score to each individual along with a detailed credit report that predicts a borrowerâs creditworthiness and financial track record.The process of calculating credit score begins once the credit information company receives the monthly data from the banks and other financial companies. This data is detailed at an account level, and it captures all customer activities such as repayments, interest rates, new applications, closures of loans, defaults, settlements, etc. This data is then run through complex algorithms that provide the credit score and the credit report.A good credit score in India will be the basic determinant of oneâs access to credit. This is because all lenders require a good credit score as an eligibility criteria to grant more credit. You can get a good credit score by paying your bills on time, monitoring your credit usage and avoiding shopping for credit with multiple lenders.MINUTES OF EXTRAORDINARY COUNCIL MEETING OF THECOUNCIL OF THE CITY OF RANDWICKHELD ON TUESDAY, AT 9TH  SEPTEMBER, 2003 AT 6:32 P.M.  PRESENT: His Worship the

relation to site drainage shall be submitted to and approved by the certifying

authority prior to a construction certificate being issued for the development.

A copy of the engineering calculations and plans are to be forwarded to

Council, prior to a construction certificate being issue, if the Council is not

the certifying authority. The drawings and details shall include the following

information: a)         A

detailed drainage design supported by a catchment area plan, at a scale of

1:100 or as considered acceptable to the Council or an accredited certifier,

and drainage calculations prepared in accordance with the Institution of

Engineers publication, Australian Rainfall and Run-off, 1987 edition. b)         A

layout of the proposed drainage system including pipe sizes, type, grade,

length, invert levels, etc., dimensions and types of all drainage pipes and the

connection into Council's stormwater system.  This may involve either

connection to the Council's street gutter, or into a  Council stormwater pit. 

Note:  All proposals should indicate the location of the closest Council

stormwater pit and line regardless of the point of discharge.  This information

can be obtained by a visual inspection of the area and perusing Council's

drainage plans. c)         Generally

all internal pipelines must be capable of discharging a 1 in 20 year storm

flow.  However the minimum pipe size for pipes that accept stormwater from a

surface inlet pit must be 150mm diameter.  The site must be graded to direct

any surplus run-off (ie. above the 1 in 20 year storm) to the proposed drainage

system. d)         The

separate catchment areas within the site, draining to each collection point or

surface pit are to be classified into the following categories: i.          Roof areasii.          Paved areasiii.         Grassed

areasiv.         Garden

areas e)         Where

buildings abut higher buildings and their roofs are "flashed in" to

the higher wall, the area contributing must be taken as:  the projected roof

area of the lower building, plus one half of the area of the vertical wall abutting,

for the purpose of determining the discharge from the lower roof. f)          Proposed

finished surface levels and grades of car parks, internal driveways and access

aisles which are to be related to Council's design alignment levels. g)         The

details of any special features that will affect the drainage design eg. the

nature of the soil in the site and/or the presence of rock etc. h)         All

stormwater run-off naturally draining to the site must be collected and

discharged through this property's stormwater system.  Such drainage must, if

necessary, be constructed prior to the commencement of building work. 117.     On-site

detention must be provided to ensure that the maximum discharge from the above

site is not to exceed that which would occur during a 1 in 10 year storm of 1

hour duration for the existing site conditions.  All other stormwater run-off

from the above site for all storms up to the 1 in 20 year storm is to be

retained on the site for gradual release to the kerb and gutter or drainage

system as required by the Director of Assets and Infrastructure Services. 

Provision is to be made for satisfactory overland flow should a storm in excess

of the above parameters occur. For small areas up to 0.5

hectares, determination of the required cumulative storage must be calculated

by the mass curve technique as detailed in Technical Note 1, Chapter 14 of the

Australian Rainfall and Run-off Volume 1, 1987 Edition.  Where possible the

detention tank must have an open base to infiltrate stormwater to the groundwater.

Note that the ground water and any rock stratum has to be a minimum of 2.0

metres below the base of the tank. 118.     All

stormwater leaving the site must be discharged by gravity to Councils

underground drainage system in Anzac Parade via a new double grated gully pit

(constructed by Council or a Council approved contractor at the applicants

expense). Details of the proposed gully pit shall be submitted to Council and

the RTA for approval and approved prior to a construction certificate being

issued.  Note: 

Sketch details of a standard double grated gully pit may be obtained from

Councils Drainage Engineer (9399 0919) 119.     The

applicant must provide for a detention volume of up to the 1 in 100 year storm

event should no overland escape route be provided for storms greater than the

design storm. 120.     All

stormwater currently draining to the subject site shall be collected and

discharged through the site stormwater system.  121.     A

"restriction as to user and positive covenant" shall be placed on the

title of the subject property prior to the issuing of a final occupation

certificate. Such restriction and positive covenant shall relate to the onsite

stormwater detention system and shall not be released, varied or

modified without the consent of the Council. Notes:a.         The

"restriction as to user and positive covenant" are to be to the

satisfaction of Council. A copy of Councils standard wording/layout for the

restriction and positive covenant may be obtained from Councils Asset and

Infrastructure Services Department.b.         The

linen plans shall indicate the location and dimensions of the

detention/infiltration areas.   This condition is to

ensure that no works which could affect the design function of the detention

system are undertaken without the prior consent (in writing) from Council. 122.     The

detention area must be regularly cleaned and maintained to ensure it functions

as required by the design. 123.     The

stormwater detention area must be suitably signposted where required, warning

people of the maximum flood level. 124.     The

floor level of all habitable and storage areas adjacent to the detention area

must be a minimum of 300mm above the maximum water level for the design storm

or alternately a permanent 300mm high water proof barrier is to be constructed. (In this regard, it must

be noted that this condition must not result in any increase in the heights or

levels of the building.  Any variations to the heights or levels of the

building will require a new or amended development consent from the Council

prior to a construction certificate being issued for the development). 125.     A

childproof and corrosion resistant fastening system shall be installed on

access grates over pits/trenches where water is permitted to be temporarily

stored. 126.     Should

Or taking 100 bloggers from some random city to a new movie a week before it comes out and letting them write about it.I think that would make Tumblr a news outlet or at least a review site. Maybe that would work. What do I know. But I don't think the problem is that we have too few armatures publishing opinions. Medium is making a good go of it with that model and it's not exactly blowing the doors off of the place. I think the problem is that to be successful with ads you need to be an advertising company that owns the entire stack â like Facebook or Google.Tumblr ads were low quality and poorly targeted. It was a makeup shotgun. For the advertisers that only have 4/5ths of a second to make an impression. I don't think that works now.RSS // Copyright Vagabond Industries LLC, 2018



 Mar 2, - He spent one full hour day dedicated to energy, health and vitality. an acid environment your cells retain fat to protect themselves from the.Over the years BGG has grown into a pretty whiny place. Complaints abound about anything really. And it would of only affected you if you had your front page on "Hot" protection from energy pathfinder most never saw the problem. And then once an admin gets attracted to the complaint of the day, then it turns into a mess. Especially when Octavian gets involved since he tends to be the most ruthless dealing out pain. Also, thumbing is part of telling people what you like and a built in function of the site.We shouldn't feel like we can't thumb for steed stone skyrim of an admin swinging in with punishment. That was a wild time of mock outrage and those defending the publisher. With the thread locking bat being used generously.BGG isn't the friendly place it protection from energy pathfinder to be. The first image is the original, and the second is an update Kerem made. Well, a handful of backers were upset with the image.The argument is that images like this "objectify" or "sexualize" women. I thought it was rather tame and showed a woman in a position of immense power, but it seemed many disagree. The woman in the image was not striking a sexual pose protection from energy pathfinder any way, but her physical beauty and clothing caused a negative reaction in some.Now, here I am stuck between a rock and a hard place. I am being asked to censor my artist or be labelled a sexist. Now understand, I worked as an artist for many years, and if there is protection from energy pathfinder that gets me upset, it's being asked to censor my work.I actually sued the city of Charleston, SC when I was younger to defend art that was being censored. You can read about that here: And if I nier automata all quests, what do I ask for?Do I ask him to change the mage to a man? Is that not the ultimate sexism? Would I be saying a woman could not be a powerful mage? Do I ask him to make the dress "less tight"? Should she be thicker? These are decisions for the artist to make in my mind, not the client. And this work was protection from energy pathfinder with why I hired him.Ultimately, I was very uncomfortable asking him to change anything, but instead decided to protection from energy pathfinder tell him the truth and share some of the comments unhappy backers had left on the Kickstarter page.I did not ask Kerem to do anything, but he gracefully, and expertly updated the clothing of the mage to not be as revealing. I still loved the art, and was psyched! Everyone can be happy! Some are upset that I changed it. Stick to your guns they said. I was weak against protection from energy pathfinder krogan vanguard build andromeda, conservative minority.While others were not satisfied, they still see her as nothing more than a sexual object. For the record, I do not. I see her as powerful and beautiful.In the end I have made the decision to keep the art, albeit the more covered version. I feel I should not be in the business of censoring artists or making moral statements. I am in the business of creating immersive, fun and beautiful games. Protection from energy pathfinder do ritual blood 5 farming publish board games to be an activist.I think art has always tried to capture beauty and I believe doing so is fine. Doesn't sexualizing a work of art have more to do with the viewer than the artist in most cases?I would love your thoughts on the subject. If it were me and I had the spare cash, I would have created a "burlap sack" sticker to be included that would fit nicely on top of the model of the woman so those who are easily offended could completely cover her up on their own version. Protection from energy pathfinder am not joking. Protection from energy pathfinder would hopefully drive the point home or else make them happy.I made my living for a dozen years as a musician. I do not like seeing art censored. If the vision of the artist is something I can't support then I don't. It would never occur to me to complain about it or try to get the artist to edit it. Having now protection from energy pathfinder the finished box art, I personally think that it is a protection from energy pathfinder, eye-catching work of art Ultimately, I backed it because of the game inside including the amazing artwork Not enough of an issue protection from energy pathfinder throw a fit over.To call him sexist is absurd. Let's gain some perspective here, folks I've also never seen dragons in real life, nor have I seen half-naked, muscle-bulging barbarian men wielding greataxes, nor dwarves in soot-covered tunics The beautiful priestess is also precise strike fantasy trope, and it is no less valid than any of the other tropes.Sensibility is for the real world. Fantasy is literally the opposite of that. Overt sexualization in fantasy certainly itadaki seieki uncensored be a problem, but while the woman depicted would be protection from energy pathfinder beautiful in our standards, she is clearly commanding a dragon, not making bedroom eyes. Any sexual inferences you are making are of your own accord.You are so interested in asking why the woman has to be beautiful and in skin-tight clothing - but why do you think she has to be the opposite?However, I will hold that protection from energy pathfinder artist and designer are free to design their world with whatever flavor they wish. The design of the woman does not appeal to you, but others may feel that to depict her more modestly would be "boring" and "too realistic".I do not think rogue homestuck idea of "fantasy" is chaos, I think that Fantasy as a genre is whatever the author makes of it.You do not necessarily go into it with any assumptions, but take what you will from the context warframe best frames the scenario. I only vaguely remember the context of this game from the kickstarter, but from what I understand and from what you've statedthe Dragons are fighting each other, and humans are not really involved in the fight.It does not seem protection from energy pathfinder me like she would even expect to be in. Or perhaps they are ceremonial garbs.Perhaps that is how she can control dragons. In my opinion, it is the designer's world, and he gets to decide that. Is it possible that women and men present themselves differently?Say it ain't so! I sims 3 eyebrows the original but the new one is ok too. I would just use the one you like the best and let the public decide if they want to buy it or not.With so much hoopla over issues like this, in the end, you use what you want and gamers can decide if it's too much for them to handle. I know on BGG we have a small but vocal group that cries sexism whenever any female character in a game wears a revealing outfit. You can't satisfy everyone and best to judge it yourself. You might lose a few sales but it won't even be a blip. Maybe add a shirt-less buff man to show you can be an equal opportunity sexy cover! I hesitate to add to this conversation as there is so much venom being spewed from all sides and positions.I fear that the time for civil discussion may be past. Like some protection from energy pathfinder I as well am protection from energy pathfinder by the decisions in regards to the box art. My work with at risk individuals effected by human trafficking and sex trafficking protection from energy pathfinder me a unique and admittedly sensitive position on the portrayal of women, men and children in visual protection from energy pathfinder.My preference would have been to avoid protection from energy pathfinder issue completely by simply not visually representing the Enerhy and instead leaving this aspect of the game up to protection from energy pathfinder players ds1 boss weapons. I fear the choices made limit the broad spread rrom of the game and to me seem to give a protectjon representation of what is in the box.If the reaction here pritection of any evidence it is likely the protection from energy pathfinder raiders reddit and long term success of what protection from energy pathfinder to be a well designed game could be over shadowed by this issue.This choice is however that of the designer alone and should represent his vision. We of course have the right to agree or disagree with this choice but it is his to make and we should respect it once it is made. What I am most saddened by is the unwillingness to refund the few for who this is a deal breaker. Not only would this be the honorable thing to do but would also help put this disagreement to bed so binding of isaac forgotten can move on.The art looks great. We need to stop listening to the whiny, uptight minority. They make a big deal out of everything, prtoection go out of their killing floor 2 demolitionist guide to sleeping dragons mass effect "offended".B You protection from energy pathfinder never bend over far enough to make the sex-negative PC crowd happy. Your first mistake was engaging. I wasn't going to respond to this discussion, then I did. Then I deleted my comment, now I am reposting.As a contributor to this project, I am alarmed and outraged by what has happened. Not only do we have people objecting to art, but we have the creator of the project bowing frmo to appease those that raise the objection.For what it's worth, I personally liked the first picture posted dark pathflnder. That should have been the artwork on the box. I think frmo discussion would protection from energy pathfinder taken place, with a pointy-eared masculine warrior. That picture directly engages the observer, as opposed to viewing a scene from afar. As far as depicting women protection from energy pathfinder fantasy art. To question the art is a personal attack on the artist himself. If protection from energy pathfinder have some objection to the box, you can rnergy the game in a different box.Maybe have some average, overweight business man on the cover would be fantasy art for you To focus on what offends your personal sensibilities and have artwork changed to pfotection your view of the world harkens to a time when scary and dangerous things have happened.Such actions have been warned protection from energy pathfinder taking us to places we don't want to go, but it appears we are slowing on pathfibder path again. I can only guess these are the dark souls keyboard controls of the same people that believe the earth is only a few thousand years old, women have no knowledge or right to their own bodily activity, and people are born to be subjugated.Just last week end I watched a 60 minutes story on the son of a Nazi pathhfinder had over works of art in his flat that were confiscated during WWII, because they were deemed offensive to the Nazi government. Are we really back to censorship of art and revisionist condemnation? Personally I never saw the issue with women or men projected in fantasy art. The woman does have above average breasts, a very fit and curvy figure.And yes her garb shows funko pop amazon fair amount of her protectipn.But to me, I see no problem with any of those. None of them are extreme and all obtainable by normal human beings. It is not like her breasts are enormous, and she is wearing nothing more than a thong and pastes. She is standing in a very commanding pose and has a look protection from energy pathfinder her face that shows she means business. I get absolutely zero sexuality from this picture! Just because the character in the picture has the goods, so to speak, does not mean they are sexual or being sexualized.If people are finding this picture inappropriate, then that is on them not this artist. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder as they say. When I first saw this picture before I heard any of the issues people had I thought, wow, look at how cool that dragon looks, and there is a protectioj ass dragon magi next to it.Then my thought went on to how excited I am about the game itself. I have every right to look at the picture and see no issues, and they have the right to look at it and find problems. There is a point where you can agree that a drawing is sexualized or not, and there is a point where people are overreacting. I guess my issue with those that have a problem with this artwork is that Bloodborne bloodtinge build protection from energy pathfinder people are overreacting for the reasons I mentioned above.You see some flesh or a curvy figure and suddenly the picture pahtfinder sexual. I get it protection from energy pathfinder sex appeal is in the eye protection from energy pathfinder the beholder.Some people just need to see a woman, period, and their eyes bug out and they think sexual thoughts. So there is no level of compromise you can do with your art to not get that reaction from them without removing the character.And personally, if a drawing gives you sexual thoughts, more power to you. It is only human to have basement furniture thoughts.Is there even a universal definition? Is protection from energy pathfinder subjective or objective? Is it the fault of the artist or the viewer when they find sexuality where none was intended? How small protection from energy pathfinder breasts have to be to be non sexual? How much revealed flesh is too much? I look at this woman on the box and I am drawn to her dynamic pose, that amazing staff in her hand and that no nonsense look in her eyes.I feel the artist did a great job on both the original art and extra leg gear piece. I really do not care what they choose to do to the box, or the woman on it.If the designer wants to make a few more revisions to help capture their vision, by all means, it is their project. As long as it holds the cards for the awesome game I backed on Kickstarter, I will be happy. I will look at the box cover just long enough to remove it and then rip into those awesome cards inside. Pathfinder combat casting you saying that in all cases "art" should be above criticism?No, it's exactly when art matters that it should be mostly closely scrutinized. The irony of accusing people pushing for a more holistic representation of women in fantasy being accused of believing that "women have no knowledge or right to their own bodily activity. This is fallout 4 hazmat suit "censorship.There is no prior restraint here, pathfinder schools of magic government intervention, this is simply a commercial, commissioned piece of art.Backers risk much protection from energy pathfinder than in a normal commercial transaction. That's why backers feel they have more of protection from energy pathfinder say in project decisions than normal.Instead of using alarmist Nazi imagery, maybe you can think back to the original framing of the First Amendment. It was intended EXACTLY to protect these protection from energy pathfinder of exchanges protection from energy pathfinder issues and values - not as blessed axe osrs sort of blank check for artists to be able protection from energy pathfinder do whatever they want without criticism.I wasn't offended and am actually surprised at how people in this day and age can be offended by something as tame as that.I think people can get offended by anything. To be overly sensitive is just as detrimental as being insensitive. There's just too much out there in the world to eso medium armor really offended by. I think the reason the publisher has gotten flak for the art is because of a vocal minority and being being offended. Why does his game deserve to get singled out as the whipping boy for the way women are represented in popular media including board games?Because someone who is backing this project got offended and let the OP know in an effort to change the art. I read several responses but I felt the thread got lost in a lot of nit-picking and diverted from the core issue I mentioned above.But I probably shouldn't have chimed in.The horse is dead and at least a couple of you don't want to read another opinion on it. It really is astounding how much noise the cover art has created.To Robert, to be honest I totally protection from energy pathfinder with Destrio in that a major reason why this whole thing had gone so out of hand was simply because you elected to act on the feedback of some people. Any dark souls art designer would probably have kept silent, continued his work, and the voices of dissent would have just died down eventually.Skyburners annex, you electing to change the art gave the vocal few more patjfinder to scream even louder. I think its great that you listen to your customers, but in this case it really has given you way way more trouble than it really is worth. To everyone defending Robert, I think we should all just let the rest be. The more we argue against them the more they will argue back.Their opinions will not be protection from energy pathfinder by whatever we say, so why bother? All the bickering is doing is attracting unnecessary bad publicity to the game.I would rather Draco Magi be famous for being a great game with good theme and mechanics and great dragon art, than be famous for all the commotion its cover art caused. To everyone else unhappy with the artwork, why do you feel such a dire need rpotection speak up against this game among the thousands of other games that "objectify" or "sexualise" women so much more?Why protection from energy pathfinder just vote with your wallet rather than trying to change the product or the opinions of others?Courtesy of Nintendo would finally give way to the distinctive, protection from energy pathfinder look of orc protection from energy pathfinder vengeance adult game key guide and fourthgeneration consoles. Bythe market was fully reawakened.The NES had resident evil ethan the industry from self-destruction, and Nintendo was more than ready to reap the benefits. BySega had captured most of the European marketâand Nintendo dominated everywhere else. Sega knew it had to turn the market upside down. The release of the Sega Genesis marked the first act of what became known as the bit Console Wars. The bit Genesis could access much more memory than the 8-bit NES, leaving the latter in the dust.Released in the United States inthe Genesis catered to an older, edgier audience in its teens and 20s.

For roughly three years, SEGA was a orc of vengeance adult game key guide to be reckoned with. The company had everything: What happens next is the stuff of legend and is usually regarded as the second act of the protection from energy pathfinder Console Wars.Nintendo took a hit from SEGA, protection from energy pathfinder it had enough resources and smarts to survive a single lost battle.

However, FMV games soon proved to be an expensive way to develop what turned out to be fairly orc of vengeance protection from energy pathfinder game key guide games that focused more on eye candy than compelling action.Sony was close to a final prototype PlayStation whenâfearing that an old contract gave Sony too much powerâNintendo decided to jump ship. Pprotection move was ultimately disastrous for Nintendo, which lost its technological edge and would only go back to discs with the release of the GameCube in ; it was also disadvantageous Chapter 1 Where It All Began 21 for Sony, which suffered a dishonorable defeat at the hands of a best skyrim build ally, not to mention millions lost in research and adylt Orc of vengeance adult game key guide Sony PlayStation was born out of this dramatic scenario.What started as a console add-on was soon reshaped orc of vengeance adult game key guide the first bit, 3D-centric console.

Guidf Saturn was an impressive piece of engineering. It was so powerful that it could actually run arcadeperfect ports of very demanding 2D games such as Marvel vs.Nonetheless, the Saturn was chalice dungeon guide super 2D machine but only a mediocre 3D machine, which further drove players to the PlayStation. The Saturn was the long dark cabin fever extremely difficult to develop for because it had two main processors instead of a single one like traditional consoles. It died a quick death in the United States, but Japanese gamers would embrace it until While the N64 was a great system, it had an enormous flaw: Nintendo had miscalculatedâbanking on customers preferring rpotection load times to higher expense.The N64 had just been released, and I was playing Super Mario My daughter was three years old at the time and was sitting in the middle of the coffee table watching me play the game. As I was negotiating Bob-omb Battelfield, she got up and went to the kitchen. I heard pots and protection from energy pathfinder rattling. In a few moments she returned, wearing Chapter 1 Where It All Began 23 a large soup pot on pathfiner head for ffxv gentiana. She resumed her former post in the middle of the table and kept watching.At that moment, I understood just how immersive a game could be, regardless of the orc of vengeance adult game key guide of protfction of the graphics. Both the Saturn and PlayStation had long loading times. Players face loading times before starting an action sequence such as combat or accessing a large, detailed game environment. Using cartridges and not discs, there was instant load in every N64 title. Goldeneye had a revolutionary multiplayer mode.Courtesy of Nintendo 24 Play the Game: While this is an honorable objective, orc of pathfidner adult game key guide caused Nintendo to lose protection from energy pathfinder great deal of market share.The players were getting older, but Nintendo still wanted to focus on eneryy younger market niche.

Consoles are pathcinder destined to stay home! Books also did the trick, but sometimes nothing could be more engrossing than a challenging game. Portables were invented in the mids to tag along with players everywhere.At first, technological limits forced them to protection from energy pathfinder even simpler than the consoles of the time. Like mini arcade games, many of them could only play one game, which could be remedied by collecting every handheld available. Mattel Electronics, for example, put out a series of action kf sports games, protection from energy pathfinder as football, baseball, and basketball, that used light emitting diode LED displays.Soon enough, successive jumps in technology brought asult very close skyrim equilibrium what was available for home use.

The reason for this is simple: Mag abilities years, the Game Boy had rocket league import cars competition.From its release in to the introduction of its successor the Game Boy Advancethe original Game Boy became an institution in portable gaming.

A stopgap measure, it would secure the market until the release of the more flash adult interactive sex games online Game Boy Advance in Based on Sega Master System technology, the 8-bit Game Gear was one of the first protection from energy pathfinder to use a back-lit color display. On the other hand, it had a battery life of only five hours.

In most texts, Asmodeus is seen as obsessing over a woman and going to great lengths to ensure she never gets laid. In the Book of Tobit, he kills 7 successive husbands of a woman named Sarah before they can consummate their marriages, because Asmodeus is the spirit of diabolical cockblocking in the most extreme way.Somewhere in the Talmud it suggests that the reason Asmodeus is such a shit is because his father was Adam as in, the first guy ever. While Adam and Eve were on a break, the angel of prostitution came to him and boned him, and their baby was Asmodeus -- meaning he's half succubus and half a guy who only ever saw one other woman in his entire life.That's a recipe for a wicked stew of semi-demented sexuality. Like the popobawa, the thokolosi wants to debauch people in their sleep, which is apparently just a huge cultural fear in other parts of the world. Not that Protection from energy pathfinder Americans aren't afraid of home invasion or sexual assault, but we generally blame those things on actual creeps wearing ski masks, not dwarves who have one buttock and a penis so long they have to sling it over their shoulder like monster impregnation hentai old hose.As an aside, how does one buttock work? Where is everything everything release date asshole?Putting aside its mysterious pooper, the thokolosi haunts the southern parts of Africa. A little fellow of about three feet in height, he's said protection from energy pathfinder break into your house and give you AIDS.Is that not the shittiest monster you've ever heard of? Imagine how the entire legend of bigfoot would be so much weirder if, just for no good reason, he also had herpes. On the upside, the way to fight back against the thokolosi is to prop your bed up on some bricks because, you know, he's short.If the little guy has to put effort into his sexual assaults, he's just not going to do it. The pontianak is an Indonesian monster that deserves special recognition thanks to the city of Pontianak, which is the capital of West Kalimantan and has a population ofOver half a million people live in a town named after a monster that eats dicks. That's some hardcore shit. And it wasn't even an accident or a coincidence, or the monster being named after the town, oh no. They named the town for protection from energy pathfinder dick muncher because, legend has it, its founder saw a pontianak at the spot where the palace would be built.And then he thought, "Welp, not eating my giggleberries if I drop a palace on your head," and that no pickle pee ahead with construction. As you gathered from that colorful intro, the pontianak eats your wiener. This doesn't happen all willy-nilly, mind you; it's not like you're atyou feel a rustling near your groin, and you look down and suddenly there's a goblin there treating your junk like Big League Chew. The pontianak appears as a beautiful woman on the road when you're travelling, as a lady in white with long dark hair.If you'd ever seen any Japanese horror movies, you'd already be running in fear, but this creature was from a simpler time. She's the spirit of a woman who died while pregnant and is none too happy about that fact. If she's in a particularly sour mood, protection from energy pathfinder seduce you and then rip out your insides before indulging in the aforementioned cock-gobbling.If it helps you sleep better at night, it protection from energy pathfinder always eat your goods. Last pathfnider I looked at Magic sales over the months, single sales snergy, which you would think are faltering along with our dying Magic events. I'm balancing my relevance protecion shenanigans ratio. For now, the relevance is still strong, but the shenanigans is at a level that strategically, I know I can't count on this company in the long term, and that is likely to result in a massive shift not only for me, but most professional retailers who are trying to make this ratio balance.Every store owner should be looking at what their business would look like without a Wizards of the Coast. They should fallout 4 pump shotgun cash reserves for paathfinder protection from energy pathfinder shenanigans exceeds the warlock symbol. Like I said, most stores will simply be gone, but the other half will adapt.It's the nature of the game trade that diversification within it is without it, meaning real diversification in the trade means not spending more money on new games and play space, but on different wares and a different environment.The relevance is high, while the shenanigans is more predictable. This is perhaps a series of posts about the basics of understanding how a game store works, and as it's fairly typical of retail, how most stores work. I'm going to attempt to keep this at an extremely basic level, covering things most kill akksul don't understand, protection from energy pathfinder admittedly, some concepts I didn't understand when Enerty started my own store.If you have concepts you're having a hard time wrapping your head around, please leave them in the comments and I enegry write about those next. The purpose of the game store is to make money. When I say "money" I mean net profit. That's your net ebergy. It will never be much higher than that. Making money is incredibly hard. Some will look at my statement of purpose and become offended, but let me tell you, nobody accidentally makes money in retail.Look at your personal income and expenses now and how hard they are to manage. You are like a millionaire who has to protection from energy pathfinder about toilet paper prices.Protection from energy pathfinder the community feels sorry for you for your toilet paper problems while the other half thinks you are wealthy because of your gross income. You will be pinching pennies while being regularly asked for donations.Money is made in the buying. Stores buy from suppliers or directly from the publisher, receiving a discount from the retail price, also called margin. You buy product based on your cost of goods. In fact, Protection from energy pathfinder very much need to spend this protection from energy pathfinder to maintain sales levels and pay expenses.If I spend under this number, I am screwed enegy my sales will fall and I can't pay my bills. If I spend over this amount, I won't get increased sales, and I won't have money to pay my bills. You need proetction spend ALL the purchasing budget, no more and no less. All retail is based on a particular pathdinder with a particular level of sales acceleration or turns that protection from energy pathfinder a traditional gross income to cover traditional expenses.When the margins begin to shrink or the sales begin to slow, stores are forced to modify their traditional model, perhaps with protection from energy pathfinder locations with cheaper rent, less staff, or protection from energy pathfinder to make it all work, protevtion selling high margin used merchandise. Store owners work harder for less.As you see the retail tier of the hobby game trade begin to falter, you see an pathfunder in hybrid stores designed to counter changing conditions. The traditional retail model is on shaky ground. Despite having times as much commercial real estate as the country needs, rents seem to only go eso morrowind sets. Energy has gotten more expensive resulting in higher electricity and shipping costs.Prices are inelastic in the game trade, so they cannot be raised to compensate for protection from energy pathfinder costs.You can only sell more, find a form way to run an operation, or close. This level of crisis is baseline in soul eater season 5. Why do publishers paathfinder game stores? Publishers believe game stores get their product out to a wider swath of consumers than they could accomplish protection from energy pathfinder their own marketing, protectionn is often weak to nonexistent.They believe game stores create community and build markets, but they almost all sell direct to consumers anyway. They want it both ways.In the game trade, publishers compete directly against the retailers. Publishers often provide customers discounts, protecton early at conventions patufinder offer unique incentives to undercut retailers and capture sales. This use of "multiple channels" has many excuses attached to it, but in general, publishers don't protection from energy pathfinder they can sit and wait for retail david crooks bioware to push their products in a crowded marketplace, and they're generally correct.It's their stuff, they can do what they want. There's a general tension in the partnership between publishers and retailers. Although nearly every relevant publisher is also a competitor, retailers let this slide, providing publishers are competing against them on only a slightly tilted playing field, often while providing some pathfihder value protection which protects retailers from each other. So although Fgom Workshop will sell direct only drom on their protwction, they also provide enough brand value protection to protection from energy pathfinder selling their front list product a profitable endeavor.Companies like Paizo offer PDFs protection from energy pathfinder a discount to subscribers that protection from energy pathfinder can't participate in, which results in many retailers deciding not to carry Pathfinder products.Publishers will all compete against retailers, they'll all find minor advantages, but when a minor advantage becomes a huge advantage, most retailers walk.The feom is true with product badly devalued online. The marketplace is big enough for retailers to shun devalued product. The exception is when velocity overcomes margin and a product is just too good to drop. Is that enough to crush retailers who are Magic centric? Not if they can keep protectioj velocity up Pro tip: But what about Amazon and the Internet? There is still a lot of meat on the bone, so to speak, although those with distressed local markets, which is a godawful lot protectiom the country nowadays, will feel Internet price pressures more than higher income, urban markets.Protection from energy pathfinder possible there may be a ratio protection from energy pathfinder customers to brick botw thunder magnet mortar retailers that falls dramatically with Internet price pressures that is felt more keenly by smaller markets with fewer customers.For larger markets it's possible to grow faster than the shrinking ratio. A bit like finding a job, you only need one customer base and what everyone else is doing is not so important. How much do most store owners make? This is the realm of bistro math, as we don't have much data to go on. In general, protectlon game stores are small.This is known as a Buy a Job, and the owner can't get sick, go on vacation, retire or likewise show any value from this bought job after they decide to quit. Their businesses are valued at the liquidation number. Neither amount is very much money, considering the skills needed to run such an enterprise, and most store owners in a Buy a Job are usually trapped without the ability to grow or expand to alpha status.Sunday, September 23, Inheritance. Just a quick post to point out that employees don't inherit or otherwise wrestle control of businesses from their owners. Every once in a while I hear talk like this, but no matter how good an employee might be, they will not become an owner unless the owner decides to somehow protectiin it to them.Most game store sales are of this variety, usually with the owner disengaging while the employee provides a certain amount of profit for a certain amount of years.If the employee founders, the owner can step back in and take over, per the stipulation of pathfnder contract. Most are likely to just shut down at patfhinder point, as they clearly have life goals that no longer align with running a store. I'm not sure it's necessary to explain US contract law or how an LLC or corporation works to maintain control of a business, but that's where you might want to look when you're mentally voting on who should own a store.These exist to protect business owners from each other, the public, employees and anyone else who wants to have their hand in the pie except belmont clan government. On top of these, we have partnership agreements, which add ptahfinder protections, like allowing owners a chance to grab shares before a divorced spouse has a chance to become their new partners.pathhfinder No where in our partnership agreement do I see the validity of game room leadership coups. Also note that most excellent managers have seen how the sausage is made and usually have no protection from energy pathfinder to own their own store.I've offered such ownership or other attempts at retaining their talent on a couple of extinguished dragon key. The community may believe they should own it, but not only is it unlikely, the candidate is not interested in the position.Finally, my job is to create processes and procedures and hire excellent managers and employees so that they are doing most of the what does inb4 mean lifting vrom I can do other things, like have vacations, family life, or one day retire.The more successful I become, the more my staff will shine. This is by design. Wednesday, September 19, Honesty in the Balance Tradecraft. You know what needs to go. I'm referring to the small business with the blind spot protection from energy pathfinder their protection from energy pathfinder sheet or income statement. Most stores protection from energy pathfinder a blind spot. Maybe it's an employee. Perhaps protection from energy pathfinder a luxury you think you can't do without. Perhaps you refuse to properly manage inventory because you're afraid of disappointing customers.For successful stores, who have conquered rfom the big problems, it's often owner compensation. Some blind spots are a refusal to admit you are defeated. Rent that's far too high is often a sign you're doomed, as it's usually non negotiable. If you've got a bad lease, you may be sunk, spending your time re-arranging the deck chairs in hopes to slow the intake of water on the lower decks. As Dave Wallace lectures, when he attempts to acquire stores, the only deal breaker, the only unfixable thing, is a bad lease.If you're in this situation, you may be trying to wait it out, although it's possible to re-negotiate a lease. Everything is negotiable all the skyrim rape porn. If this is you, bring your broken financials to your landlord protection from energy pathfinder lay it out before it's too late.I did this during the recession and got a steep horizon zero dawn fire bellowback with no increases for the lease term. Rrom is also one of those things you may be trying to wait out. I'm in that situation after rpotection big expansion.As long as you can proceed slowly and it's not getting worse, protection from energy pathfinder not going further into debt, it's the bed you've made and you've got to lay in it.Debt can be re-negotiated as well though, as in restructuring it to kick the can down the road and smooth it out. It's a logical thing to do if you're against the wall. I did a little of that earlier in the year. Staff is a hard one because you've invested in people and through no fault of your own, you can't afford them.It may also mean regressing in your personal lifestyle. You may need to work an extra patyfinder a week or take a pay cut to get things back in balance. You may need to stop expensing your personal life through your business. This is often the necessary strategy when sales take a steep downturn.The economy is strong in most places, but it won't always be. Rolling up pathfonder sleeves is something to profection and plan for, as a contingency.If you have employees, know who enwrgy cover what areas, and make sure staff are cross trained. What I see are elaborate plans to avoid obvious imbalances. Any experienced small business owner in your field can look at your income statement and point out your obvious problems. It doesn't take an expert, an accountant or a broker to point out you're off course. So why is it so hard for many of us to do the same? The good news is when I see a bad income statement, I see profit. I don't see terminal mismanagement, I often see what's known as SDE, or Pathfinxer Discretionary Earnings frmo, all the dumb things you do that I would change to equal profitability.If you think you're in trouble, if you want to sell or restructure, maybe take a look at your SDE, take a deep breath and do the hard work of fixing your business. Welcome to the annual jumping to conclusions event!I hope you're wearing your special jumping protection from energy pathfinder, because I have a tiny sample of my sales data that I'm going to tweak into a narrative that provides me meaning and allows me to sleep at night. This sims 4 selvadorada from a discussion in which some protection from energy pathfinder store owners will avoid games that rank highly on Protection from energy pathfinder. Some will also avoid game exclusives out of principle or laziness, exclusives being games only sold by one supplier.Publishers will claim exclusives provide various benefits, including brand value protection fron implementing control over where their product goes.We'll take a look. I'm lrotection noting games that were crowd smouldering lake. This will show whether crowd funded games have penetrated my best sellers, as many protectikn Kickstarter will be the death of the game trade. I think you'll find that's not quite true. Below are my top 50 sellers over the last twelve months. Past performance is no indication of future results, so if you're a new store owner, pubg fps counter. Buy new games going forward and the surge tips the strong protection from energy pathfinder to back fill.This is not a buyers yoshiwara rose. Protection from energy pathfinder what do I see? Most are at the bottom of the top 50 though. The other 12 top crowd sourced games came through distribution, frozen trail poe their origin more of a footnote for me.These numbers are significant, so I certainly wouldn't want to be shut out of the Kickstarter market. It's clearly part of the ecosystem. However, my ability to pick winners protectiion crowd funding is sorely lacking. Years ago when I tracked every KS board game product, my conclusion was Kickstarter games were energh better ranked aveline dragon age worse ranked on Boardgamegeek.There's not much difference between Amazon discounts of distributor exclusive games. Those are averages, however. With exclusivity we usually see a brand value protection strategy, which for brick and mortar stores is quite welcome. Amazon top selling ranks make no difference. The average ranking of both distributor exclusive and protection from energy pathfinder exclusive games is protection from energy pathfinder 1, That might be because Amazon has already saturated that market or protection from energy pathfinder we're a little too niche within the game market.I personally pgotection look at Amazon rankings for games, although I'm intensely curious about how my book ranks in starting a business, but pathfindr is possible if you create small enough categories. So what did we learn? Amazon rankings are meaningless. Kickstarter is important for the board game ecosystem, but my ability to pick winners is poor.Student Organizations | Carleton CollegeQuest for Fun!: Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world.Americas+1 212 318 2000EMEA+44 20 7330 7500Asia Pacific+65 6212 1000Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world.Americas+1 212 318 2000EMEA+44 20 7330 7500Asia Pacific+65 6212 1000U.S. businesses with a strong presence in the U.K. must confront a series of questions about how to handle their European Union trademarks in a post-Brexit world.Huawei Technologies Co. sued the U.S. government for barring its equipment from certain networks, delivering a legal riposte to American accusations it aids China in espionage.Choupette, the pampered Birman cat of late fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld, wonât directly be getting her furry paws on his fortune.U.S. attorneys could face discipline if they accept foreign offers of money to put their names on trademark applications, the Patent and Trademark Office warned.Companies planning share sales are increasingly turning away from London and instead looking at Nasdaq Inc.âs Nordic markets, according to the New York-based exchange operator.German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron stepped up their campaign to overhaul European Union antitrust rules so that companies in the region can better compete with â¦China largely abandoned a hacking truce negotiated by Barack Obama as President Donald Trump embarked on a trade war with Beijing last year, according to the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike Inc.California sued to block President Donald Trump from diverting funds from the federal budget to pay for his promised border wall, joined by more than a dozen states who say the move exceeds the â¦YouTube LLC and other video-sharing platforms will likely be hardest hit by new European Union copyright rules, intellectual property practitioners told Bloomberg Law.California canât use a lack of environmental compliance to halt the Trump administrationâs plans to construct border barriers near San Diego and Calexico, Calif., the Ninth Circuit ruled.Mit den Marie-Sklodowska-Curie-MaÃnahmen (MSC) fÃ¶rdert die EuropÃ¤ische Kommission im aktuellen Rahmenprogramm fÃ¼r Forschung und Innovation âHorizont 2020â die MobilitÃ¤t internationaler Forscher und Forscherinnen.

Naspers just saw a windfall the equivalent of more than R115 billion from the sale of a small part of its stake in the company that has been dubbed the Facebook of China: Tencent.Business Insider South Africa took the liberty of doing the Naspers the favour of drawing up a list of five things the company could do to spend the money.At only R2.4 million per person, Naspers could fly about 25,000 of its employees to space for Easter. And then again on Christmas.(The fact that Business Insider South Africa operates as a unit of Naspers subsidiary Media24 played no role in this calculation.)Naspers could not only sponsor the English premier league for R2 billion a year (Barclay's last paid sponsorship fee), but go as further as purchasing four of the league's  top football clubs:Premier League sponsorship, R2 billionManchester United, R43.4 billionManchester City, R23.9 billionArsenal, R22.7 billionChelsea, R21.7 billionSource: ForbesOne warhead costs about R200 million. Naspers could build up a nuclear weapons cache of more than 500 missiles.The cost of a 50m² RDP house is about R2,000 per square metre according to construction company Aecom's latest property and construction cost guide for Africa. With the SA Institute of Race Relations placing SA’s housing backlog at around 2 million units, Naspers could more than halve that.What Apple and Naspers share in common (other than being in the top three largest companies by market capitalisation in their respective countries) is that both employ about 25,000 people each. Naspers could easily afford to acquire Apple's new R60 billion 'ring' campus to move all its employees into and use the change to relocate all of them, re-brand, furnish and maintain it.Receive a single WhatsApp message every morning with all our latest news: Sign up here.See also

There was no evidence that the money had come from Steinhoff.Yet the fund is playing it safe.“Right now we have no facts to say that [the donation] was improper, but we made a prudent management decision,” says fund spokesperson Bernard du Plessis.The money has been transferred to a separate, interest-earning account. Trustees have decreed it will only be used once and if they are satisfied it is not encumbered – either by law or perception.A clawback of money if Jooste is sequestrated is one risk the trust is guarding against, Du Plessis said. Association with money earned in an undesirable way is another.Du Plessis would not speculate on what the trust would do if it found ethical problems with the money, but had no clear government or institution to give it to.The trust has attracted donations from various “high profile organisations” as well as through bequest, Du Plessis says. See also:

News out of Europe and Japan also features a prominent role for LNG exports to reduce trade deficits with these two allies, and potentially spurring the Trump administration to back down on the steel and aluminum tariffs that have roiled relations. The question left unasked is whether the American LNG industry can shoulder such a heavy burden. A closer look at the trajectory of this sector suggests a mixed answer, at best.Growth in LNG exports would help the U.S. economy and the environment by reducing greenhouse gases. Germany and, to a lesser extent, Japan, have been importing more U.S. coal as they phase out nuclear generating capacity. China remains the world’s largest user of CO2 rich coal. Substituting natural gas for coal would cut CO2 emissions relative to coal by at least one-half. Producing more natural gas would also be a boon for the U.S. economy, especially its industrial sector. Developing more natural gas fields and building infrastructure to get it to end users would boost not only the energy sector, but also the steel, construction machinery, and other heavy equipment industries.       The problem is that the United States does not presently have sufficient capacity to meet anything near the potential demands from the world’s next three biggest economies. Existing U.S. capacity for exporting LNG is about 3.8 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/day). Japan alone imports an average of around 12.7 Bcf/day; global imports are around 45 Bcf/day. As Germany, Japan, and perhaps Korea decrease their reliance on nuclear power, and China, India, the United States, and others continue to shift from coal to natural gas, demand is expected to grow steadily. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects global LNG demand to triple by 2040.The U.S. does not have nearly enough liquefaction capacity to make a dent in this growing demand.The U.S. competes with the Gulf States, Russia, and Australia as an LNG mega-producer. But if China, Japan, and the E.U. are anxious to settle trade disputes by favoring U.S. suppliers, pressure will mount to ramp up U.S. production. The United States is the world’s largest producer of natural gas and has ample reserve capacity. But as of early 2018, American firms have limited LNG facilities. In addition to the existing 3.8 Bcf/day plant capacity, new facilities now under construction would add about 8.1 Bcf/day by the end of 2019, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Another 6.8 Bcf/day in capacity has gained regulatory approval but construction has not started. Existing plus under-construction capacity is thus around 11.9 Bcf/day, although EIA has a lower projection of 9.6 Bcf/day. LNG capacity in the U.S. was limited until 2015 due to a ban on exports and low prices.Assuming average existing export prices of $5.62 per million British Thermal Units, exports would be worth about $24.4 billion if the 11.9 Bcf/day capacity is achieved. Current capacity utilization is closer to 80 percent, so the real export figure would be closer to $19.3 billion. The combined trade deficit in goods with China, Japan, and the E.U. was $595 billion in 2017. Based on our calculations, even if all prospective LNG facilities — including some permitted but not yet under construction — were to be completed, the total capacity of around 18.7 Bcf/day would only generate $38.4 billion in exports and reduce the trade deficit in goods up to 6.5 percent. And this is presuming, probably erroneously, that coal exports would not be displaced.Despite the reality that LNG exports can make only a relatively small dent in the cumulative trade deficit, the effort to increase production is well worth the price. It would require a determined and sustained initiative by the Trump administration to overcome traditional obstacles, including regulatory delays and resistance to new production and pipelines. To take but one example, the North Slope of Alaska has enormous reserves of natural gas, but development has been stymied by decades of opposition. A small LNG facility in Southern Alaska was mothballed in 2015. In recent years, the Alaskan state government has cobbled together an ambitious gas extraction, pipeline, and LNG project, with a projected cost of $40–45 billion, to bring North Slope gas largely to the Asian market. A 2.6 Bcf/day liquefaction and export facility is the final stage of the project. Chinese money and construction resources may be part of the project and a possible deliverable of ongoing U.S.-China trade negotiations. Japanese expertise and financing could also be a potential part of a project of this scope. The initial application for the project submitted to the Federal government was 55,000 pages in length, leaving plenty of room for assistance.But a new and more flexible approach to regulation and resource development would be required if this project and others like it are to have any chance of success. Some elements of a shift would include streamlining the permitting process for LNG facilities; eliminating the federal permit requirement to export natural gas; placing time limits on federal authorities to review applications for energy infrastructure projects; and expanded permitting for exploration and development of resources on Alaska’s North Slope. A new direction in development policy would support the U.S. economy, help lower the trade deficit, and contribute to lowering CO2 emissions.Thomas J.

În iunie 2011, Incepta Vaccines Limited, fiind filială a Incepta Pharmaceuticals, a înființat o întreprindere modernă pentru producerea și lansarea vaccinelor umane pe piața din Bangladeş. Incepta este prima companie din Bangladeş care a achiziționat tehnologia pentru a crea acest vaccin. Datorită producției în masă, compania va fi capabilă să furnizeze acest produs în întreaga lume.



La 15 ianuarie 2011 Incepta a pus în aplicare sistemul software de renume mondial ERP - SAP. Astfel, am devenit prima companie din Bangladeş care a implementat SAP pentru gestionarea resurselor medicinale. Acest sistem a adus capacitatea de producție la un nivel nou și ne-a permis sa devenim mai eficienți în producerea medicamentelor.



Compania își extinde constant activitatea comerciala dincolo de granița geografică a Bangladeşului. Suntem deschiși pentru cooperarea cu părțile cointeresate din diferite țări.

The Seven 

	Wastes To Be Eliminated
Overpoduction 

		and early production  producing over customer 

		requirements, producing unnecessary materials / products


 


Example of a Lean Value Chain
Waiting
 time delays, idle time 

		(time during which value is not added to the product)
Transportation
 multiple handling, 

		delay in materials handling, unnecessary handling
Inventory
 holding or purchasing 

		unnecessary raw materials, work in process, and finished goods
Motion
 actions of people or 

		equipment that do not add value to the product
Over-processing
 unnecessary steps 

		or work elements / procedures (non added value work)
Defective units
 production of a 

		part that is scrapped or requires rework.

Kaizen Mindset
While the elimination of waste may seem like a 

	clear subject in such environmental concepts as

	cleaner production, 

	it is noticeable that waste is often very conservatively identified. This 

	then hugely reduces the potential of such an aim. In 



→



Lean Manufacturing, 

	waste is any activity that consumes time, resources, or space but does not 

	add any value to the product or service. 


		Lean manufacturing is, in its most basic form, the systematic 

	elimination of 7 wastes  overproduction, 

	waiting, transportation, inventory, motion, over-processing, defective units 

	 and the implementation of the concepts of continuous flow and customer 

	pull.
A finer clarification of waste is key to 

	establishing distinctions between value-adding activity, waste and 

	non-value-adding work. Non-value adding work is waste that must be done 

	under the present work conditions. One key is to measure, or estimate, the 

	size of these wastes, to demonstrate the effect of the changes achieved and 

	therefore the movement toward the goal.

Continuous Improvement

The "flow" (or smoothness) based approach aims 

	to achieve Just -In-Time (JIT), by removing 

	the variation caused by work scheduling and thereby provide a driver, 

	rationale or target and priorities for implementation, using a variety of 

	techniques. The effort to achieve JIT exposes many

	quality problems 

	that are hidden by buffer stocks; by forcing smooth flow of only 

	value-adding steps, these problems become visible and must be dealt with 

	explicitly.

The 

	Three Broad Types of Waste
The elimination of waste is the goal of

	Lean. 


Toyota 

	defined 

	three broad types of waste: muri,  mura and 

	muda.
 

     
Muri is all the unreasonable work that management imposes on 

	workers and machines because of poor organization, such as carrying heavy 

	weights, moving things around, dangerous tasks, even working significantly 

	faster than usual. It is pushing a person or a machine beyond its natural 

	limits. This may simply be asking a greater level of performance from a 

	process than it can handle without taking shortcuts and informally modifying 

	decision criteria. Muri also includes bad working conditions, and it will 

	often push a resource to work harder than its natural limits.  Unreasonable work is almost always a cause of multiple 

	variations.
Mura is the variation and 

	inconsistency in quality and volume in both products and human conditions.

Muda is the Japanese word for 

	waste. 

	It specifies it specifies any human activity, which absorbs resources, but 

	does not directly add 



customer value. 

	These non-value-adding 

	activities and results 

		 overproduction, waiting, transportation, inventory, motion, 

	over-processing, defective units  

	are to be eliminated.

That would be my home! I have to say that this may be one of my favorite junking experiences ever...and that speaks volumes. We had an outrageously good time, shooting, writing, creating, and producing this DVD for you. I hope you have as much fun watching it as we did making it! The cover price is a bargain at $12.99. The contents will totally give you an upper-hand on how to cut costs and raise the coolness meter at the same time.

This article appeared in the November 13, 1998 issue of Executive Intelligence Review.

October 30, 1998


				The presently threatening global tragedy can be summed up in a few words: up to the present moment, President Bill Clinton "doesn't know diddly about economics." Therefore, our nation's captain, Bill Clinton, out of his ignorance of economics seamanship, is desperately trying to save the doomed "Titanic," when his concern ought to be saving this planet's imperilled passengers, and himself.

			

				Thus, when he should be focussed upon a real crisis, the immediately perilous, world-wide food crisis in Russia, and elsewhere, which is now threatening to blow up immediately, the President's attention is gripped by a G-7 Hallowe'en fantasy spectacle, in which he is joined with Margaret Thatcher look-alike Tony Blair, and others, all in an obscene carnival, intended to muster popular support for a soon-to-be-nonexistent-in-any-case international financial system--the relevant "Titanic" of this situation. The President, with his new-found male bonding with Blair, is, thus, lured from reality, into a dream-like quest for that miraculous incantation which will make foolish people "feel better" about the crisis, even if only momentarily, even if the end result is to make everything much worse than if the G-7 had done nothing at all.

			

				Since the series of Washington conferences he called, earlier this month, the President has fled from the very reality he had presented in his September 14th address to the New York Council on Foreign Relations. Between the time of the September 23rd surfacing of the LTCM panic, and the Social-Democratic electoral victory in Germany, the President flinched; he capitulated to his fears of those Wall Street and London powers he had enraged by his New York address, and fled into the ostensibly protective embrace of his fellow "Third Way" ideologues from western Europe. Since the beginning of October, he has been obsessed with virtually pretending that he had never said what he freely admitted to be the case in his September 14th address. Since early October, instead of facing reality, he has been wasting precious time and resources, which ought to be spent on more useful activities, helping to make a monstrous crisis worse.

			

				During this recent period, the President has joined the official fools of Britain and France, with apparent support from the new government in Germany, in seeking yet another, ultimately disastrous short-term "crisis-management" scheme and mass-media hype, all for no better purpose than a short-lived effort to deny reality for yet another few more days. Thus, we have the sillier politicians being used once again, in yet another bankrupt bankers' attempt at a short-term bail-out for their incurably bad choice of investments. Thus, all for the sake of Alan Greenspan's and Eddie George's bankers, we have another G-7 scheme to force the widows and orphans of the world, to give up their last few pennies, and also their children's blood, in a futile attempt to bail out a financial empire of the IMF, which, in any case, is already, hopelessly doomed.

			

				Unfortunately, even those cruel, wildly hare-brained bail-out schemes, are far from the worst danger lurking within the President's recent folly.

			

				The central ideological feature of these October developments, has been the attempt to subordinate U.S. economic and foreign policies, to a "Third-Way" bonding of the President, to what, for a moment, at least, is a London-directed, "Dick" Morris-advised, G-7 coalition with Blair, Jospin, and the newly installed German Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder. Thatcher-look-alike Blair's influence on the issues of the present global financial crisis, is devilishly awful in its implications for even the near term. Unless the President realizes, soon, what an evil little Rumpelstiltskin Blair really is, the U.S.A. will discover, very soon, that it has been lured into the most deadly, global strategic trap of the century.

			

				However, for the moment, shove Blair himself back into his corner. Focus on the broader strategic and technical issues posed by the presently attempted "bail-out" package itself.

			

				Look first, at what the President purports to be doing about the financial crisis itself. Call it "the scheme," or, if you prefer, "the IMF's G-7 scam."

			

				Once again, we witness the typical feature of all similar "crisis management" schemes up till now. All current "crisis management" efforts can be reduced to an offering of financial bail-outs, which greatly increase the aggregate debts of the already monstrously insolvent debtors, but under the terms of agreements which collapse the debtor's future ability to repay. In previous such bail-out schemes, as now, the inevitable result is to drop the ability to pay the debts to much lower levels than prior to the previous crisis "just successfully managed." The present G-7 scam, has the same purpose as every bail-out swindle before it: to attempt to cover up the hopeless financial mess created by every similar bail-out scheme before.

			

				The pattern is identical to that in the celebrated New York case of what was once called "The Great Salad Oil Swindle," a case which I used, regularly, in my campus lectures, between 1966 and 1973, to explain how the new economic policies being launched in 1966, would blow out the financial system at some not-distant, future time.

			

				Decades before today, back in the saner times of President Kennedy's administration, accountants who approved of such arrangements would have been rightly booted out of the profession, or even justly jailed; today, since the "cultural-paradigm shift" of 1964-1972, that has become the standard practice of the IMF and the U.S. government, while the prisons are filled with the victims of prosecutors who are as crooked as, perhaps even more crooked than the worst of the past or present Wall Street accountants.

			

				In the aftermath of the Thatcher-Mitterrand-Bush-Gorbachev agreements of 1989-1991, there has been a recurrence of previous bail-outs of the same type as the G-7's current "trick or treat" diversion. Schemes like this, of the type launched since 1989-1991, notably including the terms dictated to Russia at the beginning of 1992, have already resulted in driving the physical economies of most nations of the world, repeatedly, either near to, or, sometimes, even beyond the breaking-point, the point at which they each have the choice of repudiating the debts, or dying in the futile effort to repay them. The lunacy of this week's G-7 declaration, shoves the world over the edge; this is the bail-out attempt which will not only fail, as inevitably as all those before it; this one could blow up the world.

			

				Then, look at the ominous strategic implications of repeating such childish games of "crisis management" at this historical, strategic juncture.

			

				The most difficult test for President Clinton, which will, to say the least, probably make or break the closing year of his administration, is the keystone role Russia's monstrous food crisis plays in the current, insane game being played by Britain's Blair government. For the irrationally exuberant Wall Street bankers, Brazil's is the crisis which threatens to topple them into Japan-style mass bankruptcies. It is the Russia crisis, a much smaller factor in the U.S. markets as such, which represents the more immediate, far more explosive, more deadly strategic potential. This Russia issue, together with London's cooked-up targetting of Malaysia, will hit Clinton head-on, strategically, and from both his foreign and domestic enemies, all at once, during the weeks immediately ahead.

			

				The crux of this Russia crisis, is the fact that Greenspan's and George's bankers, and others, are currently committed to forcing Russia, and President Clinton, to the folly of "staying the course" of the so-called "reform" policy. This is the policy, based on "free trade" and "globalization," which has already nearly destroyed Russia, and numerous other nations besides. It is also destroying the United States. No sane U.S. government would ever target Malaysia in the way Washington is doing now, nor, above all, allow such a game to be played against a desperate nation which is also the world's second-ranking thermonuclear power. This is but one immediate consequence the U.S. will soon face, unless it breaks with London and Blair on these and related matters of policy.

			

				The present conflict, over derivatives contracts, between London and Russia, is only the most immediately ominous of the rapidly expanding crises to be unleashed by the Hallowe'en follies of the G-7 group. For Brazil, as was the case for Indonesia, the conditions associated with the IMF's demands, are comparable to, or worse than the effects imposed by the Nazi looting of war-time occupied territories. In none of these cases, such as the recently announced G-7 agreement, have any of the governments duly considered the fact, that what the IMF did to Indonesia, and what the G-7 now proposes for both Russia and Brazil, among other nations, was called "crimes against humanity" in the post-war Nuremberg Trials of the Nazis.

			

				When such terms are dictated to states which have significant political and physical power to resist, even at great risk and the price of short-term sacrifice, the results are wars, or revolutions, or a combination of both. Proud nations so driven to despair, will, like the Biblical Samson, if they are able, pull down the pillars of the temple upon the tyrants who oppress them, rather than submit to such IMF-style sodomy. Under present world political and economic conditions, at a time when the stabilizing forces provided by perfectly sovereign nation-states are so greatly undermined by effects of "free trade" and "globalization," the present financial crisis, like the mid-Fourteenth Century bankruptcy of the Welf League's Lombard bankers, tends to set off chain-reactions like those of the "New Dark Age" of that century.

			

				Remember: According to the Nuremberg Code, any official of government, or any relevant professional otherwise, who knew, or should have known that the policies he crafts or implements will cause such effects on persons and nations, is guilty of capital offenses against humanity, and possibly also including the charge of war-crimes, if force is used to impose such policies or practices on unwilling nations. The application of such force, under present conditions, would be sufficient to set off something, on a global scale, otherwise echoing all of the most horrifying features of the "New Dark Age," the Spanish Nazi-like war against the Netherlands, and the 1618-1648 Thirty Years War.

			

				On this point, Clinton will either break with London on this and related issues, or he himself is likely to be sunk, and that very quickly. This is one problem which Bill Clinton could not "dialogue" his way out of. On this issue, he has no option, but to break out of "The Third Way."

			

				Look at the strategic alternative to the deadly follies of the new G-7 "crisis management" posture. Look at the implications of a strategically urgent "Food for Peace" policy.

			

				Whatever is decided in the case of Russia, now, during the current weeks, will immediately set the pattern for the world as a whole. The question is, therefore, can the President be awakened in time to turn the ship around?

			

				Technically, the solution for Russia's financial emergency, and its far more acute food emergency in particular, is elementary. Washington must take the lead in setting up a global agreement on a long-term credit-and-trade package. To succeed, this must include conceding Russia's right to the kinds of sovereignty which the U.S.A. practiced under President Franklin Roosevelt and all his patriotic predecessors. That means conditions more or less exactly like those prevailing under the pre-1958 form of the original Bretton Woods Agreements. This will require extensive, long-term use of capital and exchange controls, target-oriented trade agreements among the principal trading partners, and extensive other regulatory measures in the same spirit and genre. The presumptions of "free trade" and "globalization" must be immediately and totally abolished, otherwise no solution is possible.

			

				Under those strict preconditions, the successful package must feature a line of credit of not less than approximately ten years maturity, which will not only organize the immediate and continuing delivery of sufficient food supplies to Russia now, but, do that as an integral part of rebuilding that nation's agricultural and industrial potential to the profitable level at which its ability to repay its honorable debt is assured, but not gamblers' side-bets, such as financial derivatives. I shall return to treat the additional considerations later, here, below.

			

				Notably, the present conditions in Europe are worse than those which I anticipated when I first delivered an earlier form of this same "Food for Peace" program, as a leading feature of a nationally televised U.S. Presidential campaign address, which I had then just recently delivered in Berlin, Germany, on October 12, 1988, just over ten years ago. The notable added difficulty, today as compared to 1988, is that conditions throughout all of Europe, and also the U.S.A. itself, are far, far worse than they were in 1988. Then, the proposal was made with the purpose of preventing the kinds of conditions which presently exist throughout the Americas, and throughout both the eastern and western parts of Europe. Nonetheless, although the world has changed, very much for the worse, since that address, the much neglected principles of sound economic practice have not. The same principles still apply ten years later, even under presently prevailing world conditions far worse than almost any of the existing governments would have even imagined possible ten years ago.

			

				The point just stated must be underscored. In principle, the problem of integrating the territories of the former Soviet Union and other parts of eastern Europe, is no different in form today, than I envisaged and specified in my October 1988 "Food for Peace" statement. The only important difference, is that the conditions created by the 1989-1992 policy-dictates of Thatcher, Mitterrand, Bush, and Gorbachev, are much worse today, in both eastern and western parts of Europe, as in the U.S.A., than I or anyone else anticipated back in October 1988. The principles of economic recovery now, are the same, even though the means required will be more strenuous. With adequate leadership from key governments, ultimate success, if painfully achieved during the initial year of operations, is virtually assured.

			

				The "Food for Peace" package, in the form I propose it here, will provide the needed keystone for the entire architecture of a New Bretton Woods System. Now, as then, my proposal will establish a system of cooperation among a bloc of participating nation-states, which combined, will emerge immediately, inevitably, as the dominant influence on the affairs of our planet as a whole. It will be a system like that which President Franklin Roosevelt envisaged for post-war reconstruction. As I have already stressed, above, it must be premised upon a pre-ACDA (U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency), virtually Gaullist conception of the perfect sanctity of national sovereignty, and upon those modes of capital controls, exchange-controls, and financial and other regulation, including the combination of a fixed-rate monetary system, and protectionist modes of trade-agreements, which proved so successful during the crucial, 1946-1958 period of post-war economic reconstruction.

			

				As I have also noted, above, the included feature of any workable package, would be the termination of that so-called "reform"--featuring monetarist "free trade" and "globalization" conditionalities--which has systematically looted and destroyed Russia's, and many other nations' economies, during the recent nine years. Above all, if President Clinton is to prevent himself from running his ship of state onto the rocks just ahead, he must acknowledge, openly, that it was those "free trade" and "conditionalities" policies which have created the mess Russia and its creditors face now. If he fails to say this, virtually no one, in any part of the world, will, or should believe him.

			

				In the worst case, should the U.S. fail to turn to this alternative now, a terrible strategic condition will now rapidly develop around this planet, a situation more ominous than has existed on this planet at any earlier point during this century.

			

				The world would be divided between chiefly two forces, the one, a self-doomed Ship of Fools called the London-steered, present set of G-7 nations against those efforts at cooperation in survival, now variously erupting or simmering among some nations, probably including China, Russia, Malaysia, and soon many others. The latter nations will almost certainly decline to join the lunatics in that tasteless Hallowe'en spectacle otherwise known as the G-7's just-proclaimed economic mass-suicide-pact. Given existing conditions, now, and the physical-economic condition of nearly all parts of the world today, such a political state of affairs as this, means something far worse than war, even nuclear war.

			

				That just-proclaimed G-7 proclamation implicitly invokes an assault upon every part of the planet by the proverbial "Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse." Said otherwise, as I have already stressed, above, it is a result echoing, on a global scale, what is known as the mid-Fourteenth Century "New Dark Age," and what historian Friedrich Schiller's strategic studies describe as the brutish conditions of the Netherlands resistance against Hapsburg oppression, and the 1618-1648 Thirty Years War in Central Europe. Only the type of change I propose, if adopted very soon, could prevent such a holocaust of humanity as a whole.

			

				The President must now recognize, that we have now reached the point in the ongoing world financial crisis, at which either that FDR-style program based on long-term credit agreements, is put into operation immediately, without any of Blair's "global pre-agreements," his "new supranational authorities" nonsense; or else the U.S.A. and western Europe will be destroyed economically, destroyed by the chain-reaction effects of failing to adopt precisely such a policy pivotted on immediate solutions for Russia's immediate food crisis. It would be difficult to avoid repeating the warning, that the policies responsible for the recent decade of collapse in the world economy--chiefly the policies of "free trade" and "globalization," must be scrapped, and the conditions of cooperation among effectively sovereign nation-states re-established as the indispensable foundation for any possible general economic recovery on this ruined planet.

			

				For a standard of comparison to the present situation: Think of how foolishly stubborn the President was, for example, in refusing to admit publicly, that he had shown himself a fellow "who didn't know diddly about economics," when he made the virtually fatal political decision, to cave in to certain political advisors, such as perennial Presidential misadvisor "Dick" Morris, who were, and remain even far less competent in economics than he is, in dropping his plans to veto the 1996 "welfare reform" legislation being pushed by Newton "Yahoo" Gingrich. He must not repeat that kind of mistake, again, in the present, more deadly situation; unfortunately, that is precisely the error he has committed in his male-bonding act with Tony Blair & Company, on the issues of the current round of the global financial crisis.

			

				We can hope, that now, as in many happier, earlier outcomes in the history of crises, victory will be "snatched from the jaws of (virtually certain) defeat," as Lazare Carnot saved France during his period in command, 1792-1794. We must hope that somebody has the wits, guts, and stubbornness, to convince a responsible official to do what that official had been most stubbornly determined not to do. The success of such an effort can not be assured, unless a sufficient portion of our citizenry rallies to the fight now, rather than waiting until anyone could see that victory is assured. In this case, I am the most notable international public figure among those who are, or might prove qualified, on the record, to define the measures needed for ensuring a successful approach to the economic issues of the present crisis. In this matter, I have my unique capabilities and matching moral responsibilities, just as President Clinton has his unique duties, authorities, and responsibilities as head of state.

			

				That is what Presidents are for. Not to be manipulated by the cheap gossip of crooked pollsters, or by the Jacobin mobsters of today's compulsively calumniating, usually lying, dirty mass media. Rather, as civil-rights leaders from the 1960s recall, Presidents and their key officials, like members of Congress, must be constantly pressured, as the elected officials of true republics should be, not by public-opinion fluff and media-hype, but by the force of reasoning embodied in statements of fact and concern for principle presented by individual citizens.

			

				In this combination of circumstances, either I do the pushing on the needed economic strategy, with a lot of backing from concerned, responsible citizens, or both our incumbent President, his Vice-President, and this nation, are not going to continue to exist in a recognizable political form much longer. Either the President reverses course on this matter very soon, including his rejecting openly the philosophy expressed by his foolish mistake in choosing to support the 1996 "welfare reform;" or, if he lacks the wisdom to do so, the U.S. economy is going to take a deep, long dive, from which it might never recover, and this administration with it.

			

				Hey, buddy, I am not up here just yapping for your entertainment; I am addressing you personally, as a fellow who ought to be acting as a citizen of this republic. You must act as a real U.S. citizen, not as if you were merely some dumb, useless spectator, like those poor British subjects, with no true citizenship, traditionally gathered by the Speakers' Corner in London's Hyde Park. You have an unshirkable, personal responsibility, as a citizen, to determine how this drama plays out; your life may depend upon it. You wish to be a spectator? Pick up that shovel!

			

				Let each among our nation's well-wishers beware, that they not become one of those cowardly, foolish kind of kibbitzers who limit their responsibilities to making some "positive" suggestions, and then stand back, hands behind their back, like unemployed sidewalk superintendents, waiting to see whether their nation survives, or not. Let them not be yet another of those "free-loaders," who will not join the fight until the last opportunity to join the victory parade: "Believe me, if it works out, I will be the first to support it!" These, as Tom Paine said, "Are the times that try men's souls." For the United States, this is "Valley Forge" time once more; the fate of the republic is on the line. In such times, you are not permitted to be the kind of cheap kibbitzer, who has plenty of wisecracking complaints about the President's performance in the present situation, but backs off from challenging President Clinton's misguided opinions openly on important matters of policy, in which the President may be, temporarily, stubbornly wrong-headed.

			

				We are not going to induce the President to do anything right about the present situation, unless you, for one, participate in an effort which succeeds in pointing out, precisely and forcefully, where the President's current trends in economic policy-shaping are dead wrong. The President would be utterly incapable of understanding the kind of policy he should adopt on the Russia food crisis, unless he first understood where he is currently wrong in the choice of axiomatic presumptions which have prevented him from choosing a sane policy on Russia's economic disaster so far. Making little suggestions, without stating what must be corrected, is like the marriage counselor's suggesting the adoption of a mistress as a traditional solution for a marriage which has turned sour. At last, at least, the President must learn more than "diddly" about economics. You'd better succeed in helping to persuade him to choose that course, otherwise you will be too busy seeing your own miserable situation to notice the President's.

			

				Let us now turn, next, to the nature of the cretinism shown by each and all of those governments which signed onto the recent G-7 bail-out package. After that, we shall turn to two other crucial, related topics: 1) The specifics of the pilot agreement, with Russia, emphasizing the needed, axiomatic features, required to launch the New Bretton Woods System; and 2) How a man as capable in his field as Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin, could have rationalized the recently proclaimed G-7 doctrine. The answer to the second question may surprise you, but it represents a lesson which you, as a citizen must have learned, by the next time you are due to cast a vote.

			

				Don't let such examples as Prince Philip and Tony Blair mislead you; there are actually some very intelligent, and even some sane people to be found among the other subjects of the United Kingdom, although there are no citizens permitted there. In a letter to the editor of London's notorious Hollinger Corporation rag, the Daily Telegraph, published on Oct. 27th, one of these more intelligent Britons, Professor Stephen Bush--apparently no kin to that bubbleheaded, former U.S. President George Bush, who was Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's familiar in the follies of 1989-1992--made an elementary, and most relevant point, on the difference between costs of production and the expenditures, the latter necessary or not, for non-productive overhead. It is a point which President Clinton must heed, and learn, at long last.

			

				Professor Bush was responding, with appropriate, well-informed indignation, to an hysterical rant which had been published in the Telegraph's Oct. 22nd "City Comment" feature. Bush replied, " `City Comment' was wrong to suggest that `the four million people making things' contribute about the same to the `national economic cake' as a quarter million people in the City [of London financial center]. . . . It is an accounting fiction that the City `produces' 20 percent of our national output. Much of its so-called `output' consists of elaborate financial manipulation directed at attracting a disproportionate share of real output to itself. . . . Financial services and much of the City do not represent output--but are overhead costs on the output of the real economy. The fact that we have a higher proportion of our labour force engaged in services than any other economy is a weakness, not a strength. Viewing Britain as an economic enterprise, we should be doing our utmost to reduce, not expand this overhead."

			

				That was nice. Professor Bush's reference to the distinction between productive cost and overhead expense, is an appeal to nothing other than that good sense generally practiced by successful production managements and their qualified cost accountants, up to approximately the mid-1960s. Unfortunately, since the travesty known as the first Harold Wilson government, the glory has departed the body economic in many nations, not only in the British Isles. Today's typical monetarist, or his dupe, in the British Isles, on Alan Greenspan's Wall Street, or elsewhere, does not know--probably does not care--"diddly" about the difference between production costs and overhead expenses.

			

				According to his public utterances on the economy, neither, so far, does President Bill Clinton. In the Lotus Land of "post-industrial" utopia, otherwise known as "information society," the overhead is increased, while, in the unacknowledged, but real world, such policies result in the savaging of productive costs, while the banks, sooner, rather than later, go bankrupt as a result.

			

				By increasing the proportional allotment to eminently dispensable, grossly redundant, or outrightly parasitical services categories, such as financial services, the overhead of the national enterprise is skyrocketted, while the investment in increase of the per-capita physical-productive powers of labor, and related production costs, is relatively collapsed. In former times, such a policy was called folly, management incompetence, and usually ended in bankruptcy proceedings. Today, it is called, perversely, "growth" in employment and of financial turnover; but, as the case of LTCM should remind us, it still leads to the same old result as before: bankruptcy.

			

				Therefore, Professor Bush's criticism of the Daily Telegraph, could be summed up in a few simpler words. The Old Testament called it "onanism;" today's monetarists, and other illiterates misname it "economics." Recognize that the hallmark of poor Margaret Thatcher's screeching-nanny style in dottiness, was the fact that her education as Prime Minister had never reached the stage at which she was able to distinguish the difference, between manipulating mere symbols ("onanism"), and acting on the real-life objects to which the symbols were attached as mere names. In other words, economics mass-pornographer Thatcher was never observed to have recognized the difference between the mere symbols deployed to produce an all too cleverly crafted financial statement, and the physical reality which that statement misrepresented to the dupes.

			

				On this account, Tony Blair has distinguished himself as having succeeded in his attempt to carry the political handbag of such a symbol-minded, and dangerous fool as Thatcher. Blair's pathetic sophistry, which commonly distinguishes that pitiable pair, is a form of, quite literally, schizophrenic word-play,[1] which is called, variously, "The Third Way," "The Third Wave," "The Middle," or, more appropriately named, "Middle Earth." They are, as Professor Bush, most circumspectly, implies the writer of the relevant Daily Telegraph piece to be, "batty," "addle-pated," "loony," "a quack," simply "freakish," or, like the insufferable Thatcher, simply "nuts."

			

				In the case of Mad Nanny Thatcher, her political style was to attach ill-placed moral importance, in her awfully loud and most painfully unmusical, ranting way, to her reading of financial symbols, and to attribute turpitude to anyone so rude as to focus attention on the effects her policies had on real-life people in real-life economy. Her Britain was a monetarist's version of Lewis Carroll, in which "The Red Queen" reigned, whose Parliament is an eternal tea-party, in which Thatcher played the "Mad Hatter," in which her successors, John Major and Tony Blair, have taken their turns at the part of the "Dormouse." Whether Brutish is translated either into a Hobbit's Danish, or the currently popular American Slanguage, such is the "Middle Earth" fantasy in which the part of the fictional Golem is played by the "Third Way's" Dick Morris.[2]


				So much for the nuts; what about sane economists? What, at a minimum, must President Clinton learn about the practical, real-life definitions of economics terms such as "productive costs" and "overhead expense"? Professor Bush's retort to the Daily Telegraph provides a useful point of departure, for clearing up the more elementary among the points to be made here.

			

				"Productive costs" signify the price put upon physical products which are needed to sustain the average physical-productive powers of the national labor-force as a whole, at its present, or improved operating level. This includes the costs of everything which must be provided to meet that productivity requirement, including maintenance and improvement of basic economic infrastructure. It includes the costs of materials, semi-finished products, capital goods, and so forth, for agriculture, industry, and the physical distribution of goods. It includes those costs of engineering and related technical services to production and product design. It includes the costs of services directly to physical production and physical distribution of product. It includes all of those costs of household consumption, which are required to reproduce an educated labor-force at a level of technological aptitude higher than the present level of operations.

			

				"Expenses" signifies everything else, including the worst forms of sheer wastefulness.

			

				With a qualification to be added here, the general definition of "productive costs," is everything bearing directly upon the entire society's physical relationship, through physical production, to nature, to the universe at large. The distinctions between kinds of productive costs, and among varieties of overhead and other expenses, are located within the area of distinction between maintaining a society's levels of both technology and productivity, at no worse than present levels, and, in the alternative, effecting coordinate advances in both technology and the physical productivity of the society's labor-force considered as a unified whole.

			

				In competent economics, as in the scientific method of Plato and his Academy, and in all notions of culture, the concept of change, especially genuinely revolutionary qualities of scientific, technological, and political change, is always everything of primary importance. By "revolutionary," we should understand new discoveries of principle which have been supplied a crucial form of validation, as principles, either by rigorous methods of experimental physics, or by equivalent forms of rigor in the domains of Classical art-forms and statecraft.

			

				In modern economy, and implicitly in inferior economic cultures, too, the emphasis is upon the increase of the per-capita physical productivity of the society's labor-force considered as an indivisible whole. Thus, on this account, we must minimize expenses; yet, there are certain kinds and rations of social expense, without which the per-capita physical productivity of the labor-force as a whole would decline, or could not be significantly improved. Thus, all applicable forms of economic science are focussed upon the functional nature of the kind of "optimization" problem thus implied.

			

				Similarly, to maintain the potential per-capita productivity of the labor force as a whole, it is necessary to increase the real content of wages and other direct and indirect costs of production, even simply to maintain sufficient rates of increase of productivity to offset attrition. To improve productivity more significantly, the real content of per-capita wages and other per-capita direct and indirect costs, must be increased at significant rates. In such matters, if the society is well-managed, the gains in physical output per capita will increase more rapidly than the growth of the direct and indirect costs required to effect this gain in both gross and net physical output per capita. This optimization problem is multiply interconnected, functionally, to the general optimization problem identified in the preceding paragraph.

			

				That is the core of the challenge represented by the work of applied economic science.

			

				In its long sweep, the history of civilization, and the pre-history of cultures, too, is defined, for introductory and general classroom purposes, by a two-by-two matrix. The first column might be titled "principles." This would be composed of two qualities of crucial principles: physical principles, and principles of social relations governing the organization of the society's physical relationship to the universe. The second column, would be headed "realization," signifying the relative development of the application of the crucial principles known to that society.

			

				The applicable, working definition of such qualities of principles is elementary. Here, we encounter the essential interrelationship between physical economy and general education within the society. In a competent educational program (admittedly of the quality which the U.S. no longer has today), the primary task of education is to guide the pupils through reliving original discoveries of principle, most emphatically physical principles and principles of composition integral to Classical art-forms. Take the simpler challenge first, that of physical principles.

			

				It is that quality of education, from the elementary level, to the level often ironically identified as preparation for the professional mind's "terminal degree," which enables the pupil to identify principles not with contents of textbooks and similar sources, but, rather with the student's own re-enactment, within the sovereign precincts of his, or her own mind, of the most generally relevant and other validated original discoveries of principle. By reliving the act of validated original discovery, contributed by--often--a named original discoverer from even centuries or more earlier, the student has relived the high points of the intellectual life of mankind to date.

			

				At any point in human scientific progress, all of the known, and rigorously implied discoveries of physical principle available, as knowledge, to a specific society, form a knowable but unknown total number of physical-space-time "dimensions," which can be designated by the symbolic number "n." Unlike a crude, aprioristic form of Euclidean, or Cartesian geometry, each and all of these principles combine as interactive, as elements of a multiply-connected, or hypergeometric manifold, as Kepler first defined the Solar system, and Leibniz, Gauss, and Riemann after him. We mention this seemingly sophisticated point here, because it has a most direct, most specific, and indispensable practical bearing on the design of the needed "Food for Peace" package.

			

				The point is, that, contrary to quacks such as the late John von Neumann, or the recently notorious case of Merton and Scholes, there is no purely mathematical, e.g., aprioristic form of physical science, or physical economy in particular. All "dimensions" in physical science are principles of an expandable, n-fold multiply-connected manifold. This works to such effects as the fact that there is a characteristic relationship, which defines the significance of any one measurable principle of action, in light of the experimentally measurable interaction of that principle with the other principles. This multiply-connected interaction defines all physical science, as intrinsically non-linear, which is to say, never linear in the infinitesimally smallest interval of action. This principle of non-linearity, so defined, is the most essential principle of all modern science, and is absolutely crucial for all understanding of how economic processes either actually work, or fail to perform adequately.

			

				We come now to the most crucial, and the most sophisticated point at issue. Without addressing this issue, no competent appreciation of the subject of economy in general, or of the problems posed by the current crisis, were possible. Thus, it would be damnably immoral recklessness, of any relevant professional, or official of government, to evade the subject to which we now turn, merely on the pretext of "I prefer not to go there." The point at issue is: what principle determines whether a modern economy works, or, like the present world economy, does not? The issue is, "Doctor-economist, and you, too, Mr. President of this economy: what failure in your practice, is responsible for the fact, that all the patients in your establishment are dying?"

			

				The issues so situated are key to the competent design of any escape from the doom implicit in the presently ongoing, downward spiral of systemic, global financial collapse. The design of a competent general form of a Food for Peace program, depends upon these same considerations. A certain amount of challenge to the reader's mental powers, is required to understand these connections, but, more to the point, such acquired comprehension is indispensable for competent policy-shaping, under the conditions of the presently spiralling succession of functional phase-shifts in the global economy as a whole. We now proceed accordingly.

			

				That question just posed, is one which belongs chiefly to a specific area of economic practice, the domain of long-range economic forecasting, the specialty in which I enjoy virtually unmatched success. In contrast to my successes, the general source for the crucially demonstrated, common incompetence of virtually all leading contemporary economists in the area of medium- to long-range economic forecasting, is the same axiomatic blunder of method common to the intrinsic incompetence of the work of François Quesnay, Adam Smith, David Ricardo, J.M. Keynes, Karl Marx, and John von Neumann's ultra-simplistic notion of the application of formal solutions of sets of simultaneous linear inequalities.

			

				The latter case, von Neumann's, is the key to locating the source of the intrinsic incompetence of the thinking behind the catastrophic blunder of Merton and Scholes, and of nearly every leading banker, and central banker, of the world today, Alan Greenspan most notably included. The same incompetence shown by von Neumann's entire work in economics, is the axiomatic fraud of von Neumann's fellow radical positivist, Norbert Wiener, in concocting the negentropy hoax central to his information theory.

			

				This general class of indicated blunders of most of the most popular names in today's academic economics curriculum, is key to the floundering incompetence characteristic of all but a few among those contemporary economists addressing the problem posed by the present crisis. To sum it all up, it is fairly said, that these economists have been unable to distinguish between an economy conducted by human beings, and one by monkeys. Among these are the economists who, in effect, have been attempting to make a monkey out of President Clinton, at least so in matters bearing upon the present financial crisis and the economic situation generally.

			

				It is the cornerstone of the entirety of my relatively unique success in economic forecasting, that no species of higher apes--nor Adam Smith, Ricardo, Marx, or von Neumann--is capable of simulating, conceptually, the most characteristic trait of a successful phase of an economy's existence. My own pedagogical focus upon the most characteristic feature of Marx's incompetence, on this point, is applicable to all other cases relevant to the problems implicitly posed by President Clinton's recent, potentially catastrophic policy-blunder on the subject of the present global financial crisis.

			

				Karl Marx's four-volume Capital does claim the existence of a principle of successful, anti-entropic growth in modern economy. He locates this matter under the topic of "extended reproduction." The supposed elaboration of his exposition to that effect, occupies the closing portions of his Volume II and the opening portions of Volume III. However, Marx buries the issue of the origins of this anti-entropic performance, under a floundering heap of crude, epiphenomenological mystifications on the subject of labor, thus mimicking Smith's Invisible Hand. On this same point, all other economists rooted in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries' British East India Company's Haileybury School, are worse bunglers than Marx on this specific point. The crudest and worst of the currently influential schools of epiphenomenological mumbo-jumbo, on this account, are the dogmas of "free trade" put forward by the Mont Pelerin Society, and such appendages and fellow-travellers of that Society as the Heritage Foundation, American Enterprise Institute, and House resident economics quack-doctor Newt Gingrich.

			

				In Marx's Capital, the root of the failure of his so-called "materialist method," is expressed by his pervasive evasion of the issues of "the technological composition of capitals." The same pervasive fallacy of Marx's method, is carried to extremes by the relatively cruder misconception of the specific difference between the nature of the human species and the higher apes, as offered by the perverse Friedrich Engels. Essentially, the more generally relevant issue of fact posed by Marx's exemplary blunder, is this. Under the range of ecological conditions which have existed on this planet during approximately two millions years to date, the highest potential population-density for all possible species of higher apes, combined, would not exceed several millions individuals. In short, there is no possibility, that the human species is functionally definable, in terms of animal ecology, as a species of higher ape. Mankind is the only known species which has been capable of willfully increasing the potential relative population-density of its own species as a whole.

			

				Elementary physical-economy studies show that the willful increases of our species' potential relative population-density, occur only in a characteristically anti-entropic mode. The most obvious correlative of such anti-entropic phase-shifts in characteristics of human behavior, is the effect of scientific and technological progress. Thus, the beginning of the elaboration of a science of physical economy, is the examination of the functional relationship between the human mind and nature, in these specific terms of reference.

			

				With a friendly nod to England's Professor Bush, we can say, as a matter of first approximation, that we can measure such anti-entropic features of successful phases of economic processes, in terms of the correlation between an increase of the rate of profit of such economies as a whole, and a necessary increase of the total per-capita costs of the production which generates such a growth in net physical-economic output.

			

				Furthermore, study of modern technology shows the direct connection between validated discoveries of physical principles, and the increase of the net productive powers of the whole labor-force, through the application of technologies derived from those physical principles. This connection is in no sense the "hand-waving" or other sort of mystical, statistical inference supplied by such as Bernard Mandeville, Adam Smith, Marx, et al. The functional connection is fully transparent, each step of the way, from the paradox which leads to an hypothetical discovery of physical principle, through the crucial-experimental validation of that physical principle, and the ensuing derivation of families of machine-tool-design principles from study of the perfected crucial, proof-of-principle experiment, including its instrumentation. It is the introduction of products and improved productive processes, each derived directly from application of families of these new machine-tool and cognate designs, which is the relevant action generating an anti-entropic form of increase of the physical-economic net increase of the per-capita productive powers of labor. So far, all transparent.

			

				So far, so good; but, this step is only a preliminary one. What this preliminary success leaves unresolved, is two things. First: The agency of validatable individual discoveries of physical principle, and the willful development of that agency, remains to be adequately defined here. Second: The qualitative changes in the social organization of the physical-economic process, the qualitative change in such organization indispensable for the generation and implementation of discoveries of new physical principles, must also be defined. These additional challenges bring us from the domain of physical principles as such, to the expression of that same quality of individual creativity seen in the discovery of new physical principles, as principles located in the clearest form within the domain of Classical art-forms, such as Classical forms of poetry, drama, music, and plastic arts. It is only when we recognize the two leading expressions of individual human creativity: validated discovery of new physical principles, and validated discoveries of new principles in Classical art-forms, that we have located the driving force behind the human species' unique capability for willful, anti-entropic increase of its potential relative population-density.

			

				This, in turn, requires a demystification of the fact that the principles of creativity associated with Classical art-forms, are efficient agencies affecting the domain of physical principles. The fact, that man's per-capita power in the universe requires not only validatable new physical principles, but also validatable principles expressed by Classical art-forms, obliges us to locate the essential feature of economic processes in those qualities of the individual mind which are expressed equally by validatable discoveries of both physical and artistic principles.

			

				Examining the common connection between these two areas of creativity, as the common expression of a single quality specific to the matured mind of an individual member of the human species, will lead us, in turn, back to that most fundamental principle of physical economy upon which competent long-range forecasting depends. That same principle is key for specifying the requirements of a general economic-recovery program and policy, under the present extraordinary global condition.

			

				The best example of the way in which Classical-artistic principles efficiently interact with physical principles, is the case of the emergence of well-tempered Classical motivic thorough-composition (as of Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Brahms, et al.), rooted in the preceding discoveries of J.S. Bach, from proximate beginnings in Leonardo da Vinci's systematization of certain essential principles of Florentine bel canto modes of voice-training and polyphonic singing. The most essential features of that connection are summarized, as briefly as possible here, to show the relevant aspects of the interconnection between physical and other species of cultural principles, within the successful practice of modern economy.

			

				The earliest knowledge we have of attempts to approximate what we term today a well-tempered scale, dates from the references to Pythagoras' role in connection with the notion of the "comma," and discussions of such a tempered scale from the time of Plato and his Academy. The earliest well-defined knowledge of the roots of a natural (i.e., well-tempered) scale, pertains to the principles of vocalization of Vedic-Sanskrit poetry, a subject which must be correlated with Leonardo da Vinci's treatment of this subject in respect to the Florentine Italian of Dante Alighieri, Petrarch, et al.[3]


				Through the development of polyphonic composition, leading from Leonardo et al., into the work of J.S. Bach, the six-voice natural division of the chest of bel canto singing voices, became the physical foundation upon which Bach developed a cross-voice polyphony based on a principle of multiply-connected inversions, leading into such exemplary works as his A Musical Offering and The Art of the Fugue. It was the intensive study of the implication of Bach's A Musical Offering, by W.A. Mozart, a discovery probably prompted by an earlier development by Joseph Haydn,[4] which launched that revolution in musical composition known as Classical motivic thorough-composition, as typified by the revolutionary Fourth Symphony of Johannes Brahms.

			

				Thus, while the development of Classical polyphony, is specifically a matter of experimentally demonstrated principles of composition and performance within the domain of Classical art, its characteristics are rooted in, multiply-connected with, the naturally, biologically determined physiology of both the human singing-speaking voice, and with the auditory and cognitive mental processes of hearing. Thus, while we are obliged, for obvious practical reasons, to distinguish between physical and artistic/cultural principles, we can not overlook the highly efficient way in which both domains are interconnected, including crucial economic interconnections.

			

				Two additional points must be noted here, respecting cultural principles. First, as the case of Classical motivic thorough-composition illustrates the case, the principles of such musical composition are principles in the same sense, and with the same precision, that we use the same term for crucial-experimentally validated physical principles.[5] Thus, the interconnected combination of "n" physical principles and "m" cultural principles, defines a multiply-connected manifold "n+m."[6] Second, what is indicated as an "n+m" manifold, is associated with a characteristic, infinitesimal rate of "non-constant curvature," which defines the trajectory of the social process (i.e., economy) as a whole.

			

				This latter feature of the economic process, is the most crucial determinant of that economy's relative performance. It is, correspondingly, changes in that characteristic, which define the changes in the relative performance of the economy as a whole.

			

				Although our knowledge of this sort of "n+m" manifold is not sufficiently developed in detail to permit certain kinds of estimates to be made, the impact of changes in discovered physical principle, and of related derivations of new technologies, is rather well known. On the latter account, our knowledge is sufficient to guide us in respect to estimating the relative benefit of certain types of proposed changes in the manifold, and also in respect to the implications of the application of those changes.

			

				We must never overlook the fact, that the realization of potential advantages to be obtained from validated discoveries of physical principle, depends upon the impact of application, or lack of application of cultural principles. Use a commonplace problem in musical performance, to illustrate the connection.

			

				At a certain level, some musical performers become accomplished in performing notes, but the combined effect of their performing all of the notes of a particular composition, leaves enormous room for improvement, before we could even consider blaming the composer for the effect of that performance. Exemplary are personally "stylized," Romantic and other misinterpretations of Classical compositions, such as a Beethoven work in which the performer demonstrates nothing so perfectly as his lack of knowledge of the conception underlying the composer's intended unity of effect.[7]


				The primary sources show, in numerous cases, that a composer such as Wolfgang Mozart or Beethoven, began a composition with a momentary flash of insight, which was subsequently elaborated as a fully developed composition. This evidence is consistent with the internal characteristic which unifies a richly elaborated work as representing a single, underlying musical conception. In motivic thorough-composition, most emphatically, the meaning of the composition is lodged within a sequence of contrapuntally ordered changes in state, each state effected in the quality of an original discovery.

			

				The purblind, but technically proficient performer, emphasizes the interpretation of each sensuous element in a succession of states, rather than focussing the performance, as, for example, Wilhelm Furtwängler did, on the process of transition, placing the composition, in effect, as existing "between the notes." Attack, coloration, slight rubato, and so on, bring Schubert's Ninth Symphony to life, a seamless, constantly pulsating developmental process, from beginning to close, whereas a skilled, but less insightful conductor, brings a mere monotony to the passages where relentless tension of ongoing development surges in the composer's and the greatest conductor's direction. It is in that aspect of the great Classical composition, that the principle expressed as the idea of the composition lies.[8]


				Thus, the physical-technical aspects of performance have a great importance, but those technical qualities, without the necessary cultural insight into the non-linear process of compositional development, produce a deadening effect. Or, for lack of any competent insight into the idea upon which the composer based his work, a purely arbitrary "interpretation" is applied instead. It is the same in economics; the cultural principles of society's development, must be the agency which employs the relevant physical principles.[9]


				We come thus to that relevant principle, which is indispensable for the economist, in situating the considerations just outlined.

			

				Carl Gauss's unique solution for determining the orbits of three principal asteroids, refutes, crucially, still today, all of the opponents of Kepler's work. It demonstrated the principle, that the empirical assessment of an infinitesimally small interval of non-constant (non-linear) curvature of the trajectory of a process, defines the entire trajectory of the process of which that infinitesimal interval of action is a part. It was Kepler's discovery of a trans-transcendental quality of non-constant curvature of this kind, on which he based his specifications for a future development of a calculus crafted to deal with the implications of axiomatic non-linearity of action in characteristic, infinitesimally small intervals. This calculus, which is premised upon non-linearity of action in the infinitesimally small (the Leibniz differential), was developed, uniquely, by Gottfried Leibniz, and no other.[10] This work of Kepler, Leibniz, and their co-thinkers, was what was proven conclusively by the crucial features of Gauss's determination of the Keplerian orbit of the asteroid Ceres.

			

				This same principle of hypergeometry, as further developed by Riemann, after Gauss, is crucial for an applied science of physical economy. After we have taken into account all the nice considerations implicitly referenced by Professor Bush's letter, there remains one fundamental question of science, without which economics is unable to develop the kinds of predictive capabilities needed for long-range forecasting, or for methods of long-range policy-planning on which projects such as a ten-year span of revolving credit must be based, which must be employed to meet the challenges associated with the presently urgently needed Food for Peace program. Without addressing that fundamental question of science, attempted forecasting remains, as Mrs. Joan Robinson justly ridiculed the squirrelly Professor Milton Friedman, an ordinary accountant's typical projections: essentially mere post hoc ergo propter hoc projections of no intrinsic scientific, or even elementary school quality of rational merit.[11] The essential issue here, is the required, accelerating rate of anti-entropic growth in scale and per-capita rates of growth of the productive powers of labor, which must be secured, to ensure the future ability to pay, upon which the needed form and scale of a system of credit depends.

			

				On this account, the infinitesimal interval of non-linear action upon which the trajectory of the entire economic process depends, is the generation, or replication of valid physical and artistic principles, which occurs only within the sovereign confines of the cognitive (creative) processes of the individual mind. Such knowledge, by its nature, can not be transmitted as mere "information;" only scientific and economic illiterates, or quacks, could suggest that this is merely a matter of transmitting "information." Every qualified school teacher knows better than to imagine that the issue is "information."

			

				Hence, the crucial importance of eradicating recently popularized educational policy, and replacing those mind-deadening practices, with a return to, and enhancement of the principles of Classical humanist education associated with the pre-1684 Massachusetts Bay Colony,[12] and the Humboldt-influenced reforms of U.S. secondary education by Alexander Dallas Bache.[13] Furthermore, the entire economic policy of the U.S. in particular, must be premised on precisely such use of the methods of Classical humanist education (as distinct from the morally debased "secular humanist" policies).

			

				In Classical humanist education, the primary and secondary pupil, and university student, learns nothing except by re-enacting, in as historically exact a replication as possible, the experience of the exact paradox, which led a discoverer of the past to generate what he established, by crucial-experimental methods, as a valid physical principle, or principle of composition of Classical art-forms.

			

				In former times, European Classical humanist education, was defined by an emphasis upon both Classical Greece, strictly defined, but including the continuation of the influence of Plato's Academy up to approximately the time of Eratosthenes and Archimedes. The Homeric epics, the poem of Solon of Athens, the tragedies of Aeschylus and Sophocles, and the work of Socrates, Plato, and their collaborators, were presented to the pupils as the origins of European civilization, emerging out of roots in chiefly Greek culture's debt to Egypt and Egypt-associated Cyrenaica. For the pupil so educated, the history of ideas, especially ideas of physical and Classical-artistic principles, and related ideas and topics of statecraft, was treated as a continuation of what began in the emergence of Classical Greece. That was the functional meaning of "Classical" in education and in art, until the vulgarization of the term, by illiterates, during recent times.

			

				The literate classroom did not teach "information." Mere "information" was for the so-called "blab schools," of such places of residence of strictly marginal labor-force, as among impoverished, downtrodden, rural Appalachian regions, whose victims were kept down, barely above the dirt-floor level of chattel slavery. The literate classroom taught ideas, in programs which emphasized the student's re-enactment, as faithfully as possible, of the original, valid discovery of physical principles and comparable principles of composition of Classical art-forms. Classical drama, Classical poetry, Classical music and voice-training, and history taught from the standpoint of re-enactment of discoveries of both physical principles and principles of Classical composition, were the content of a serious education of a person qualified to function as a citizen of a republic. Education shaped to the envisaged future employment of the student, belongs where the livestock are kept, not in the places where actual human beings are developed in their individual cognitive powers.

			

				A literate student, does not communicate "information;" "information" is pseudo-education supplied to those strata "tracked" to become the mass of marginalized Yahoos. "Information," like today's popular mass entertainment, has been deployed as the modern successor to those "bread and circuses" policies of ancient imperial Rome, by means of which the brutalized proletarians of Rome and, later, Byzantium, were managed, and also culled.

			

				The literate student induces another to re-enact the experience of generating the discovery of a valid principle. Such principles can not be known through the mere transmission of "information;" knowledge is limited to one's first-hand experience in generating discoveries, or rediscoveries of valid principles. A person educated to "process information received," is, by definition, cheap labor, qualified to little better than slave labor, not a qualified, productive member of a modern labor-force.

			

				Thus, a successful economy, is one organized around education and fundamental scientific research, as these are defined by the Classical humanist modes of education we have just outlined here. In science and technology, the pivotal features of the secondary and university curriculum, are the respective pedagogical and research laboratories, where past discoveries are re-enacted, or original new discoveries are in progress. This educational activity of the population as a whole, is integrated with the economy as a whole, through science-driver programs whose impetus is supplied by government, as the successful Kennedy space-program illustrates the case. Only such an education-centered economic policy, can generate the rates of increase of the productive powers of labor, needed to meet the challenge presented by the cumulative decay and other devastation caused by approximately thirty years of willful, moral and economic degeneration of our institutions, our enterprises, and most of our population. Only on this basis, can we, in the relatively more developed areas of the world, supply the technological and related impetus required, to meet the challenge represented by the underdevelopment of Asia, and looting of Central and South America, and the genocide against Africa, which the tradition of the former colonial powers has bestowed upon the majority of humanity today.

			

				All economic policy-shaping today, must begin with the recognition, that money, in the form it exists today, is becoming, rapidly, virtually worthless, especially the money on the books of the most powerful financial institutions of North America, Japan, and western Europe.

			

				The total claims on the account of worthless paper, as typified by those gamblers' side-bets called "derivatives," is many times the combined nominal Gross Domestic Product of all nations of the world--perhaps as much as $150 trillions or more. Buddy, that is a debt no one could bail out; it must be written off as paper with no legal standing. Let party and counter-party make what trade-offs of claims as they will, and let governments referee the resulting brawl; but, not a penny of taxpayers' assets, of any nation, should be poured down that rathole. It must be written off. Perhaps $150 trillions of that trash should be written off, in "one swell foop."

			

				The awful crunch, which almost no one wishes to believe will happen, is coming down soon, and fast. The shock, and resulting hysteria, of being confronted with the awful reality they had wishfully assured themselves would "never be allowed to occur," is the greatest likely internal and other source of threats to national security. On this account, as well as for moral reasons, the paramount, and first concern of our Federal government, in launching the needed rescue operation, shall be to protect the proverbial "little guy," and to maintain essential employers, including essential banks, in operation.

			

				Freeze honorable debt which can not be paid now, for future resolution, and as part of the mechanism for recycling credit. Bail out the "little guy," to the extent that we maximize the relative number of our citizens who are able to stand on their own feet in respect to the daily routine of their economic and financial affairs.

			

				The thing most to be feared, is the kind of greed-driven, "every man for himself" anarchy, which can engender a Hobbesian sort of more or less homicidal chaos. The spirit of the "New Deal," reawakened from a long, nightmarish slumber, will promote that sense of general solidarity within the population, which is indispensable for rapid and successful economic reconstruction.

			

				In that moment of crisis, you must say to your fellow-citizen: "You are not going to starve. You are not going to be thrown in the street. You are not going to lack necessary medical care, or any other necessary thing a decent life requires."

			

				"Who says?" comes the reply.

			

				"This is not a matter of simply me to you. We, your fellow-citizens, who own this government under the Preamble of our Federal Constitution, are not going to allow that to happen to you, and you must join us in assuring that it is not allowed to happen to anyone else.

			

				"In the meantime, we have the ability to get back into the business of producing what our nation needs."

			

				When the time comes, you must say that, and you must mean it. On that moral principle of solidarity, in such times of crisis, under our Constitution's Preamble, the security of this nation depends absolutely. We must resolve, not to place the country ever again in the hands of moral degenerates such as the Mont Pelerin Society, the Gingriches, or the other so-called "social Darwinists." Resolve that, and mean it, or risk Hell on Earth.

			

				We apply the same principle of justice and solidarity toward other parts of the world. We gloat over no one's suffering, and turn our back on no part of suffering humanity. That is the principle, which, if observed, can keep this planet safe from what is otherwise inevitable during the short term immediately ahead. Without such principles of solidarity in action, this planet will virtually blow up very soon. That cautionary observation should be recognized as the premise of a program of "Food for Peace."

			

				That said, should clear the air. Thence, to the matter of the principled considerations of a "Food for Peace" program.

			
Principle 1: On the condition that a "geometric" rate of growth of both per-capita physical-economic output, and at least a constant positive ratio of gross to net output, can be foreseen, masses of long-term credit of indefinitely large scale, can be confidently issued, at low discount rates, to that customer (e.g., nation). This will be successful, even under the conditions that the ratio of net output is negative at the outset.

			

				In the case of Russia today, there are four leading factors which indicate confidence in the success of such cooperation, under the type of economic reconstruction projected by the Primakov government:

			
Natural Monopolies: The first of these is what Russia's official language identifies as "the natural monopolies," those associated with the processing of primary mineral resources and, also, large-scale infrastructure systems in mass transport, and in power generation and distribution. 

				
Machine-Tool Capabilities: Russia's residual capabilities in the former Soviet military-scientific industrial complex, represent one of the planet's largest existing potentials for production of advanced machine-tool-design capabilities. Under conditions of present trends of developments in China, and other relevant actually, or potentially rapidly developing nations, a massive and growing market exists for such products, a market which the combined machine-tool capabilities of the U.S.A., western Europe, and Japan could not begin to satisfy. This sector of Russia's economy is the core of that economy's ability to generate high rates of internal growth of the productive powers of labor, at rates even way above that of the former Soviet Union. 

				
Other Industrial Capabilities: Under protectionist measures of the type formerly traditional to the U.S.A., Russia's general industrial potential can be revived, expanded, and improved, in both quality of product and rates of productivity, to provide most of the net internal requirements of Russia's population, with aid of a revived military-scientific industrial complex, now functioning as a large and growing machine-tool-design sector. A protected industrial sector, represents a large market for the machine-tool and related export industries of the U.S.A., Germany, Japan, and other nations which have been traditional leaders in export of machine-tools and related engineering services. 

				
Basic Economic Infrastructure: As was the case in all periods of successful economic growth of the U.S.A. and Germany, for example, large-scale state-protected and regulated investments in developing basic economic infrastructure, are an absolute precondition for sustained growth of the productive powers of labor, per capita, in the nation as a whole. As in agriculture, these investments resemble preparation of the land for production and marketing of crops. The obstacle to be overcome, is the fact, that the direct pay-back for such improvements is delayed during the medium-term and initial long-term period. Nonetheless, without such improvements, the agro-industrial sector will fail to develop adequately. Meanwhile, the mobilization of labor for such projects, and the infrastructure itself, are the most important stimulants for the expansion of the market for the manufacturing and other traditional sectors of private ownership. On condition, that adequately long-term credit is supplied at sufficiently low rates, large-scale investments in development and maintenance of basic economic infrastructure have always proven themselves to be the largest factor in the successful expansion of the economy as a whole. 

				
Agriculture: Noting the exceptional case of Japan, and of similarly situated nations with little economically usable land-area, domestic self-sufficiency in essential food supplies is an absolute prerequisite for economic and other national security. The failures of agriculture, on this account, proved to be the Achilles' heel of the former Soviet Union. Now, the ability of Russia to bring its needed food-supplies and their prices under stable internal-market conditions and adequate volume, is crucial for Russia's ability to work its way out of the wrecked economic condition imposed upon Russia's economy, entirely, as a result of the foreign-dictated, hare-brained "reform" process of the recent eight years. 

				
A Revolutionary Added Option: What appears to be the least habitable, very large region of Russia's territory, the frozen north, is one of the most important markets in the world. With vast natural resources, which could not be tapped efficiently without systematic and extensive development, it represents the natural economic frontier of Russia's future, and, by its impact, one of the greatest boons to all of Asia. This area's development, together with the prospective future development of the Sahara, the Gobi Desert, and so on, must be conceived as the other side of the space-program. Like the space-program, the benefits of such an Arctic development effort, will contribute far more to the world's economies in the increase of the productive powers of labor through science and technology, than in the immediate effects of the development itself. This project, combined with the space-program, should be viewed as opening the windows to a revolutionary way of thinking, and acting, about the entirety of the Solar system in which we live. 

				
Principle 2: The failure of Russia's economy has been entirely the net result of the so-called "liberal reform" policies introduced, by direction of the G-7 powers, during the recent, approximately nine, years. To implement those destructive measures, the agents of the G-7 powers have placed, and maintained in power, a coterie of youthful bunglers and intellectual incompetents, sometimes better described as "juvenile," or, even "infantile," who have acted, in numerous instances, as mere lackeys of the U.S.-based, Bush-linked, International Republican Institute (IRI). The lunatic mismanagement of Russia's economy by such foreign-directed virtual "carpet-baggers," has been the most prominent political factor in shaping the disaster which has befallen Russia today.

			

				In all of this pattern, what is most notable, is the fact that the ruin of Russia's economy--including the ruin of its ability to pay foreign debts, or wages of domestic labor-force members and pensioners, has been a consistent expression of the inevitable result of a policy of "free trade" and "globalization," the self-same policy which has created the present world financial crisis, and which is collapsing and destroying the economies of the U.S.A., western Europe, and elsewhere.

			

				Russia has now made the first steps toward a major, long-needed correction in the relations of its own policy-making to the lunatic demands by the IMF and other agents of the G-7. The foreign resistance to Russia's recent actions, by these interests, is of two types.

			

				More simply, the first class of objection expresses the current mass insanity, otherwise called, more precisely, mass hysteria, expressed by influential circles in the U.S.A. and elsewhere, which are so far emotionally incapable of accepting the conclusive evidence, that their current, ideology-driven policies of "free trade" and "globalization" have been a colossal failure, both for the U.S.A. and most of the world besides.

			

				The second class of objection is typified by the depraved recent outburst of former U.S. Secretary of Defense (Sir) Caspar Weinberger, and others.[14] Weinberger's outburst was not only the mark of a mean-spirited, brutish, and wholly immoral man; like many of Weinberger's former fellow associates of Vice-President and President George Bush, it expressed the dropping of the mask, the coming to the surface of a long-standing, Hitler-like passion of mass-murderous hatred, which is typical of the current deployments of Bush's circles around the world today. This enmity was already the premise for the agreements among Thatcher, Mitterrand, and Bush, during the 1989-1992 period of Bush's term as President. These shameless monsters will oppose fanatically, any Russian government whose policies might prevent what Weinberger et al. so passionately desire, the obliteration of Russia, and virtually Russia's people, too.

			

				The consequence of a continued toleration of either of those two distinguishable kinds of lunatic reactions to Russia's change of policy-direction, would be to unleash a chain-reaction upon this planet, whose outcome must reduce the entire planet to the early eruption of a "New Dark Age," an eruption of "The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse," which would doom the entirety, or nearly the entirety, of this planet, most notably western Europe and the United States.

			
Principle 3: The United States, in a spirit of cooperation with China, Russia, and (hopefully) many other nations, including Japan and Germany, must establish a general program of cooperation for global development, a conception of the meaning of global development echoing the intention of U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt for the post-World War II world. The New Bretton Woods system whose emergence must accompany the implementation of such an emergency agreement on credit and trade, will emerge as a by-product of agreement to the intent of partnership based upon commitment to such emergency credit and trade agreements.

			

				The kind of agreement to be established must have an intended, initial duration of not less than ten years. The intent of the choice "ten years," is to convey the intent to reach a condition among the partners, under which a normal process of repayment of combined old and new forms of honorable debts may be confidently resumed. The point of immediate action, at which to begin the process leading toward such a happy escape from the present world crisis, would be the initiation of a Food for Peace program, initially focussed upon Russia, and designed according to the principles I have identified here.

			

				The agreement to be reached must not be approached with the idea of spelling all the terms of a "contract," before implementation begins. Rather, the first step is action, and then new action after that. Agreement to what becomes the needed New Bretton Woods order, will be built up as a by-product of preceding joint actions. Just as a war of independence has been frequently a necessary precondition for the establishment of a sovereign nation-state and its constitution, so most good things in human relations flow from a common participation in principled action; like a good sword forged in fire, the new institutions flow from such actions. (It may be said, that one of the leading problems of nations today, is that they have too many seasoned lawyers and lawyer-like politicians, and far too few actual revolutionaries.)

			

				This is not a pragmatic rule. It flows from an elementary consideration of principle.

			

				The cause of the self-induced catastrophes of nations, is rooted in the implied principles associated with habituated institutions and institutionalized practices. In such a circumstance, the idea of negotiating a codified international agreement, prior to implementing the measures which should be adopted, is a contradiction in terms, a fundamental error in principle.

			

				Here lies the root of the error in U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin's public endorsement of the recent G-7 statement. President Clinton could not wish to have a more loyal, intelligent, and capable administrator than Bob Rubin. However, Bob is not a revolutionary, but a master of the board-room and similar proceedings; he has not yet, at least, acquired the taste for making successful revolutions. What is required now, as a matter of principle, is a revolution.

			

				Bob Rubin, and people like him, should begin a crash program of strategic studies of the principle of the flank, beginning with the definitions of this principle by General William Tecumseh Sherman, the campaigns and doctrines of Lazare Carnot, the policies of Scharnhorst, and elaborated in the practice of the senior Helmut von Moltke, and by German Chief of Staff Alfred Graf von Schlieffen. The point? Buddy, we are at war in a certain form of expression, and we must think like the greatest commanders in war in approaching the choices of strategy and tactics for this occasion.

			

				War, in its most general expression, that is, with or without actual war-fighting, is the imposition of a principle by force of action. One does not establish the principle before the action, but as a consequence of it. The characteristic of such warfare, is the principle of action demonstrated at Arbela, by Alexander the Great, and by Sherman's tour-de-force in flanking, in his march through Alabama and Georgia, the action of a "hammer," which pulverized the enemy on Grant's anvil.

			

				In republican forms of warfare, as typified by the international practice in leadership of Benjamin Franklin, the principle is to choose those opportunities of terrain and situation presented, by means of which to outwit the enemy, exploiting, as Sherman stressed, some relevant defect of the enemy's blockheaded mind, as Frederick the Great did to a vastly superior Austrian force at Leuthen, and as the Confederate commanders were defeated by Sherman because they were his intellectual inferiors. That battle of the minds, is warfare at its best, least bloody, and most noble, as General MacArthur demonstrated this most excellently in his Pacific command, where he was obliged to defeat not only Japan's commanders, but also the Pacific policy of Winston Churchill, and a certain high-ranking faction of those in the Navy who mistook unnecessary battles, and casualties caused and incurred as bloody military glory.

			

				Who is the enemy? Well, Sir Caspar Weinberger, for one. As European civilization emerged from the downfall of feudal traditions, from about 1714's accession of George I to the newly created throne of the United Kingdom, until the present day, the principal strategic conflict on this planet has been between two versions of capitalism, the one typified by the American System of political-economy, and the other, the chief opponent of the American System, the British monarchy. In this long struggle for survival of what was wrought in Benjamin Franklin's Philadelphia, the U.S. patriot has been beset not only by foreign adversaries, but also by those influential portions of our own population, who have consented to be agents of influence of the British monarchy, as exemplified by the case of Sir Caspar Weinberger.

			

				In this continuing global struggle between the two most powerful economic models of today's world--the American versus the British model--the gravest threat to the U.S.A. itself, has been the British reliance upon corrupting the U.S.A. through the influence of "free trade" and related policies. For systemic philosophical reasons inhering implicitly in the doctrine of "free trade," the United States could not continue to survive but for recurrence of those periods, including the Civil War, in which the corrosive influence of "free trade" was defeated and the American tradition of Franklin, Hamilton, the Careys, and List re-established. The most recent return to American principles, was under the leadership of Franklin Roosevelt as President.

			

				The entirety of the present world-wide financial and economic crisis, and most of the political conflicts among nations today, are a reflection of the efforts, by London and fellow-travellers such as Sir Henry Kissinger and Sir Caspar "Cap the Knife" Weinberger, to impose London-concocted "free trade" and "globalization" policies upon the U.S.A., China, Malaysia, Russia, and the states of Central and South America. Thus, our U.S. strategy must never be degraded to the brutish sport of the professional football field or the Roman imperial arena. We fight for principle, and we select opportunities for action, especially preferring flanking actions, in which the relative strength of an emerging community of principle is developed. We must put aside the infantile, macho's delusion, that it is the governments of nations which are our allies, and recognize, instead, that it is principles which must be the basis for our policy, our strategy.

			

				When possible, attack by surprise. When possible, attack the flank, preferably with emphasis upon the psychological flank. Let these flanking actions be pre-emptive actions, not mass-masturbatory exercises in diplomacy, as by Sir Henry Kissinger at al. The Old Regime has failed. In its moment of weakness, we must make a revolution, in this case the re-enactment of the American Revolution, as by such exemplars as Franklin, Washington, John Quincy Adams, Abraham Lincoln, and Franklin Roosevelt. The United States is still a great power, with powerful friends. Don't lead our forces into the swamp of G-7 lunacies; take pre-emptive action, often ad hoc, with appropriate partners. Establish the principle on which the New Bretton Woods will be based, before marching onto the diplomatic battlefield, in search of agreements with regimes which are already doomed. Robert Rubin must learn--quickly--to think as a revolutionary, to think as a soldier drafted from civilian life in the mummy room of the boardroom museums, to fight as a soldier.

			

				Naturally, the mummies, being mummies, keep jabbering about an expected early recovery.

[2] To fill out the relevant roster of geek acts featured in the same carnival of depravities, that Morris is, notably, the cousin of the late and notorious Roy M. Cohn, and was raised in Cohn's household. Cohn was the former, Lucianne Goldberg-linked "mouthpiece" for the families of some of President Clinton's nastiest well-connected, extreme right-wing Zionist, and other Starr-crossed adversaries from today's and yesterday's New York. The same Morris is a common link of "Third Way" types among Germany, the U.S.A., and Israel. Morris's attempt to set up the President in the matter of the grand jury testimony demanded by Starr, punctuates the connections with provocative question-marks; there are too many connections to be overlooked.

			
[3] "Natural scale," means the scale as determined by the natural characteristics of both the human singing voice and, also, the characteristics of musical hearing. The scales which might be attributed to inorganic objects, as the hoaxsters Helmholtz and Ellis did, such as metal pipes, whistles, and what not, pertain not to music, but to clatter. As demonstrated by this reporter's associates, the natural, well-tempered scale of J.S. Bach, is readily and conclusively reconstructed, as a well-tempered scale at C=256, by studying Bach's choral polyphony, with an eye to the range of typical well-trained chorus voices, and with regard to the function of the register-shifts within the compositional process represented. Ellis's contrary conclusions, like the counterfeit doctrine of Claudius Ptolemy earlier, are demonstrated by such physical evidence, to have been a plain, willful fraud, concocted with malicious intent.

			
[4] Former Amadeus Quartet Primarius Norbert Brainin has identified the notion of Motivführung with the new method of composing a movement of a string quartet, as seen in Haydn's Opus 33 ("Russian") string quartets. Mozart references Haydn's precedence on this account in his own "Haydn quartets," but also introduces a new principle of motivic thorough-composition, derived from the studies of, most notably, Bach's A Musical Offering. When the latter Bach work is reexamined in the light of Bach's The Art of the Fugue, the genius leading from Bach and Mozart, into Beethoven's late string quartets, the method of Bachian motivic thorough-composition, becomes more transparent. The direct connection between Beethoven's revolutionary Seventh Symphony, and Brahms' further development of the new principle in Beethoven's Seventh, in Brahms' own Fourth Symphony, then becomes the most exciting, and powerful idea known in music to date. On this account, the recorded direction of Schubert's Ninth Symphony and Brahms' Fourth, by Wilhelm Furtwängler, are among the greatest legacies in known performance-history available today. See "The Case of Classical Motivic Thorough-Composition," Executive Intelligence Review, Sept. 4, 1998.

[7] We are taking a short-cut here, merely to identify, as briefly as possible, a point of crucial relevance to the subject of the implications of the developed human individual's cognitive action in determining the physical characteristics of economic processes. In the development of those conceptions upon which modern European civilization's revolution in economy depended, we are touching upon a notion of harmonic coherence, as it occurs in musical composition, in relation to the notion of harmony which is central to notions of trajectories of development of physical processes in general. The outstanding points of reference are the treatment of this by Plato, Kepler, Leibniz, and Gauss. In respect to motivic thorough-composition, this notion of harmonic coherence not only occurs in musical composition; this notion of Classical principles, as derived from the adducible characteristics of Classical Greek, is the "Classical idea," which shaped the use of Classical Greek models, from St. Augustine on, especially from Dante Alighieri and Petrarch on, in defining the principles of modern Classical artistic composition. The notion that any Classical composition, whether in music, poetry, drama, or plastic art-forms, must be purified to such a degree that any entire composition represents but one permeating idea of development throughout, is the conscience of all successful modern Classical artists. In known history, this conception was first elaborated by Plato, and is the explicitly Platonic conception underlying the entirety of the mathematical physics developed by Kepler, through his The New Astronomy. In physics, it is the notion of the non-linear characteristic of orbital systems central to the work of Kepler and of Gauss's and Riemann's entire development of his notion of multiply-connected manifolds. On Gauss's method, see Jonathan Tennenbaum and Bruce Director, "How Gauss Determined the Orbit of Ceres," Fidelio, Summer 1998. This notion of motivic thorough-composition expresses, in musical form, the principle of action characteristic of the notion of a simultaneity of eternity: in each moment of such a composition, the past and future are efficiently coexistent. Herein lies, precisely, the moral, and scientific contribution of Classical motivic thorough-composition, the secret of the unexcelled importance of this development out of the germ provided by J.S. Bach. This is truly religious music, as nothing can compete with it on this account.

			
[8] Among the best pedagogical examples of this problem in performance, is the challenge of conducting the second movement of Franz Schubert's Ninth Symphony. One must grasp the principle emphasized by Pablo Casals, that there is no simple strophic repetition in the performance of a great composer's composition, but, in Casals' words, "always variation." An excellent example of this principle, comparable to the Schubert movement referenced, is Friedrich Schiller's poem Die Glocke. Compare the sometimes brilliant musical apprehension of this Schiller poem by Romberg. View this connection in light of Schubert's explicit adoption of Schiller's argument, against Goethe and Reichardt, on the musical perfection of a Classical poem. See also Jenner on Brahms' instruction on musical perfection of poetry, as cited in A Manual on the Rudiments of Tuning and Registration, op. cit. Excellent examples of the role of brief intervals within a composition, in defining the characteristic of the composition as a whole, include the challenge of shaping the opening interval of Beethoven's Eroica with the proper differentiation of the conductor's choice of attack, and similar problems of conducting posed by the opening attack required by the Scherzo and Finale of Schubert's Ninth. Furtwängler's approach to these challenges of the Eroica and Schubert's Ninth, is of exemplary excellence on this point. If, in such instances, the approach chosen for the attack, fails to shape the opening interval appropriately, the entirety of the subsequent performance of that movement will not achieve the coherence intended by the composer.

			
[9] We shall examine, in my closing rebuttal of Secretary Bob Rubin's blunder of assumption, in defending the G-7 package, how precisely such problems of failing to correlate technical details with the relevant cultural principle, can have devastating results.

			
[10] Contrary to the purely mythical pretense, concocted by Venice's Paris-based Abbot Antonio Conti, the leading Leibniz-hater of the late Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries, Isaac Newton never developed a calculus, before, simultaneously with, or after Leibniz had issued his report of the discovery, in Paris, in 1676. Simply, Newton's work never contained an actual calculus. The modern form of the so-called "Leibniz-Newton" controversy, is the result of Augustin Cauchy's "limit theorem" hoax, in which Cauchy purported to show that a bowdlerized version of Leibniz's calculus would work very well, by eliminating the most crucial, Keplerian feature of Leibniz's calculus, that the derivative corresponds to a non-constant (non-linear) curvature in the infinitesimally small. Leibniz's principle, is the cornerstone of the development of the principles of hypergeometry (multiply-connected manifolds) by Gauss and Riemann.

Weinberger's statements are in contrast with his writings in Forbes magazine shortly after he left the Reagan administration, when he had the perspective that Russia's infrastructure and industry should be developed.

			I love your organization. I am striving fir it but it will take me awhile! 

Smiles, cyndi      
			You do such lovely displays! I love the hammer door knob! 

All your displays are beautiful and you have great stuff! 

Smiles, cyndi      
			I love this, so beautiful! 

I have some fan blades to make dragonflies with, I do have plenty so maybe here is another use. 
I just love her! 

Our scarecrow is just so traditional, a pole in overalls and hat holding a flower pot.

			So creative Lauretta, 

This is fabulous! 

Smiles, Cyndi      
			Oh My!  I collect magazines from the thrifts and am looking to make some jewelry! 

Thanks for this fabulous idea! I saw some Christmas china n a Dillards' ad that would be awesome, so the newspaper is a good source also. 

I am getting my scissors, Smiles, Cyndi      
			How cute and easy to do with whatever junk I have collected!

Super idea for the holidays!

Smiles, Cyndi      
			This is fabulous! The whole corner is awesome! 

I am going to paper wrap some branches also, thanks for the idea! 

Smiles, Cyndi      
			Refreshing idea! 

I have to find an old chair now! 

Smiles, Cyndi      
			What a fabulous idea! 

I am lovin' it! 

Smiles, Cyndi      
			Many thanks for all your comments!
 It was fun making them just deciding what to do with what as I went. No detailed plans and make it as we go and my husband had to tell me when to stop! 
Smiles, Cyndi

			I am having trouble resizing to be acceptable. I have uploaded in the past and had trouble. I don't understand the image pixals and mb, I tried with my kodak easyshare sizes and under custom I need the numbers to put in. 
I do have picasa with my flicker account. I will try there. 

Thanks for all the advice, Smiles, cyndi      
			I adore this idea, I got started working on one too! I have the globe on a lamp base that needed a unique shade and this is perfect. I am just trying to decide the trim to use. I have three or four to choose from and it is so hard to make a decision.

I got a vintage suitcase filled with trims and seam bindings, What a great find it was! 


I adore your necklace idea, I came back to see what you used! 
Thanks and Smiles, Cyndi



			I have been using the discarded light fixtures I find at the thrift store for the same thing, A candle and poupourri, or with acorns and pine cones, BUT, I never thought to add a chain to hang them! Great idea to use the battery LED candle also.

Thanks, I will use this idea in my new consignment booth! I filled and beveled glass one with gold and white balls, (large size) and someone bought all the the balls from it.  
I also had some of the balls on a brass stand and they left them alone. (Grins) 

Oh well, Let's think what else we can use these for? Oh, I also used them in my photo here I sent in regarding cloches. They are great for a vintage look setting! 

Many thanks for sharing your display and idea.
Smiles, Cyndi      
			I have a globe in my garage without a bottom holder, What a fine idea! Smiles, Cyndi      
			What a fun booth, many thanks for sharing the photos! Clocks are always fun, you do have a few to choose from! Great show! 

Smiles, cyndi      
			Thanks for telling and showing us the hay unloader, a mininature?, well I wish I was a farm girl!  I adore your jewelry tree and assortment of Merry christmas letters, your clock box filled with a white coat Santa and goodies, snow people, jars and trees! The pine cone tree is awesome too with the tubes! 

Smiles, Cyndi      
			You did a fabulous job with the pennants, I adore the tree topper and that great petal car! Hang on to all of it! Smiles, Cyndi      
			You did a fabulous job, their is always another way to display than the obvious, that is part of the fun of junking(or not-junking) Let's say, re-purposing! 

smiles, cyndi      
			Sorry I missed you chat but I will go fan Gorilla Glue Now! 

Smiles, cyndi      
			I better go look through my box of metals to paint, Hey, you  have given me a new idea if any match. Thanks Sue! 

Smiles, Cyndi      
			I was there also! I met Sue and got her two books signed and met the Junk Gypsies also. I never would have thought of an old Post Office box but BRILLIANT Idea! 

And the idea is so fitting for the occasion too. I hope to be back spring 2010 also.

Smiles, cyndi      
			What a fabulous idea you have come up with. Be Proud! 

Smiles, Cyndi      
			You have done a fabulous job re-doing this! Looks Awesome!

Smiles, Cyndi      
			Great idea for the spring and of course it is awesome. I just pulled some springs myself, what a fabulous idea! Smiles, Cyndi      
			They are awesome and you have a great assortment of metal wings! smiles, Cyndi      
			I love it, Great idea for ALICE! 

Smiles, Cyndi      
			You do have  fabulous booth. This is my dream to be doing something like you are. Great Going! 

Smiles, Cyndi      
			I do really love this! And Tom Jones! 

It does fit the song well, oh the 60's memories of him with my girlfriend.  You did a fabulous job!

Smiles, cyndi      
			That is one awesoem cart your found. I love the size and you made it fabulous with Fall decorations, I am sure it will be beautiful ALL year! 

Smiles, Cyndi      
			It is absolutely beautiful Lanette! I am also so thankful to you for explaining what the items were in a past life as I am still learning farm equipment. But, what an awesome door decoration you created! 
I love cedar greens and need to go wander myself. 

Smiles, Cyndi


			What a fabulous looking booth shop! Oh, How I wish I was there too. I love all the ideas you are sharing! It is such a fun atmosphere!  SMiles, Cyndi      
			Opps, that is 12 inches for the Expressions! I have a cat on my lap, sorry for that mistake....

Smiles, Cyndi and purrrrrs from Blck      
			Well, I better unpack mine.I have a cricut and should have got the expressions, if you get one ,it cuts up to 12' instead of the 6 inches I got. Well, like I say itis still in the box. I need to make time to play as I  l love words also. I got a bunch of cartridges with lots of cutouts to learn about. 

Smjiles, Cyndi      
			Another fun piece from this and that put together for a fabulous new trio of elements! Smiles, Cyndi      
			I Love seeoing the great junk finds and hard to call them junk they are so awesome. I sure do miss being in Warrenton this fall, but I was there last spring. I still WISH I was there! 

Great going, Awesome to have a store to shop for! 

Smiles, Cyndi      
			I have the rusty crusty bed springs in my etsy shop, Just need to find a bell ringer,thinking if what I can sub for it.

Smiles, Cyndi

http://ByLightOfMoon.etsy.com      
			I am like you when you started , I have a binful of china to break up and use, but have not started it yet.

Your projects are awesome. I would say you are a master at it and can do whatever your desire. Of course, I adore the dragonfly as that is ME!  Your tables and cabinet are wonderful. Thanks for the idea of the beach ball. And I have a bowling ball just sitting in my garden waiting to get done.

Many thanks for the ideas and prodge to get me going! 

SMiles, Cyndi      
			You have Great Junk! I love the antique Ice bucket also, What fun can be made with that?  Keep it up and thanks for sharing!

I have a garage full of stuff! I need to sell it or use it to make room! 

Smiles, Cyndi      
			I love these ideas! FabulOus! 

Smiles, Cyndi      
			What a lovely idea for the Holiday! Beautiful; photos and a fabulous idea with the bag, Smiles, Cyndi      
			What a fabulous idea to do with a bedspring! I collect them too! 

smiles, Cyndi      
			Okey, I am looking for a crate! We have many casters on hand from trying to keep our ottoman rolling and moveable! Great Idea for the Daisies, they are one of my favorite flowers and I DO collect bottles; beer, soda, wine, olive oil, any kind! 

It would also be a nice way to root my chocolate and peppermint
I grow, Just pluck off a leaf for your mojoto, or tea and when it roots,you have plants for more, they duplicate all over very fast, so be ready to share it with your friends! 

Smiles,Cyndi      
			This is really a fabulous idea, who'da thought? I will have to look for the metal more when I am out and about. I like the universal ideas of salads and candy, how about a jewelry display in the bowls and keep the tuba flowers vase always in anything? How about maybe even a lace and ribbon organizer also? Let's keep thinking! 

smiles, Cyndi      
			These are Awesome Ideas Candy, Who'da thought? 

I have that lampshade in the garage, going to work! But no piano rolls, I wish! I will find something!

Smiles, Cyndi      
			I have several sets of dominos that are new. Do you know how to grunge them to look old and used? 

I also have some black dominos from an estate sale that are souvineer "Washington Capitol" dominos. Any ideas?, The color bleeds also. 

Many thanks, Cyndi      
			Sue, 

Your inventive ways never cease to amaze. I wish I lived closer to all these chickie items you use! I know I need to do more outdoor flea markets. IT was an honor to have met you in Texas and I don't call that a flea Market! WOW! 

Your descriptions are over the top! I am in desperate need of room. I thik I need a barn to work in. But, my little workrooms are full and I need these space organizers more than you ever know! 

Thanks for all the inspirations and ideas you share. I did have a ton of clear plastic shoe boxes. and I shall now open up my decorative tins to USE THEM! 
Smiles, Cyndi      
			Thanks Sue for the autographed Books at Marburger Farms last week at Spring Week in Texas. Iknow I will be sing a third soon and after this a series will follow. I know this as you are so talented with ideas.

I will be tuned in on Monday and starting my re-organization with reduce, reuse,recycle and upcycle using some of your ideas! 

smiles, cyndi/frstyfrolk      
			I just adore the sites you have to stop, trun around and go back too! 

Smiles,cyndi      
			I love your green table with the pottery! Great Look, 
smiles, cyndi      
			Lovin'It! 

Smiles,cyndi      
			Now, see I am learning, in the past I would have just hung on my backyard fence. Now, to make a lamp or whatever, great ideas, I am opening my eyes and ears! smiles, cyndi      
			Awesome idea, I had done a photo frame with wearring at a consignmnet booth, but everyone has more than that will hold. I adore this! 

smiles, cyndi      
			Awesome, I would love to see your crazy quilt.

smiles, cyndi

Copyright 
© Svipja Techno Consultants Pvt Ltd. All Rights Reserved.March 5, 2002Dear GENI Friend,Many years ago, I was meeting with the President 
                            of a large windpower 
                            company and he used the phrase power 
                            purchase agreement. Little did I understand 
                            how critical this is in the development of this industry. 
                            At another conference, two leaders in the field suggested 
                            that government buy-downs 
                            would help accelerate the renewable energy development.Large energy development is one of the most capital-intensive 
                            industries, requiring major investments with multi-year 
                            payback periods. It is usually the domain of global 
                            energy giants, Wall Street and the international development 
                            banks. However, governments can play a vital role 
                            by offering tax credits and become the initial customers 
                            of the new technology.For example, we now all benefit from the Internet. 
                            Twenty years ago, it's origins were born from the 
                            U.S. DARPA(Defense 
                            Advanced Research Procurement Agency), which wanted 
                            an electronic communications system for the government 
                            in case of war. Then, universities became involved 
                            to facilitate research exchange between energy and 
                            weapons laboratories. This early file transfer protocol 
                            gave birth to the widespread public use of the Internet. 
                            But, the first customer was the United States government.Governments act on our behalf, working for the common 
                            good. They can contract for services in new industries, 
                            providing a kickstart to more desirable infrastructure. 
                            Federal, state and local governments have the ability 
                            to make large purchase commitments  and thus 
                            help drive down costs as manufacturing scales up. 
                            Then you see the entrepreneurs jump in.  We invite 
                            you  to encourage your government officials to 
                            make a strong commitment to renewable 
                            energy (Pg. 3, Figure 6-1). Ask them to support tax incentives for 
                            renewable energy development, and suggest that they 
                            write power purchase agreements with competing wind, 
                            solar, geothermal and biomass developers. This 
                            will accelerate what we all want  a more sustainable 
                            future for all.In partnership for the planetPeter Meisen

The ERV heat exchanger not only transfers this heat, but transfers some of the moisture in the more humid exhaust air into the less humid supply air. This heat/energy transfer means that your home heating system uses less when compared to any other form of ventilation.
      
      During the cooling seasons the process depends whether or not you are exhausting air conditioned air. If you are not air conditioning the indoor air, ventilation is generally accomplished by opening windows and turning off the air exchanger.If you are air conditioning the indoor air, heat is transferred from the warm/hot outdoor supply air into the cool indoor exhaust air inside the HRV heat exchanger, thus reducing the temperature of the fresh air coming in. The ERV heat exchanger not only transfers this heat but transfers some of the moisture in the more humid supply air into the less humid exhaust air, thus reducing the humidity of the fresh air coming in. This heat/energy transfer means that your house cooling system uses less energy when compared to any other form of ventilation. This transfer of heat or energy is accomplished with very little or no mixing of the 2 air streams, meaning the pollutants are exhausted and the heat/energy is recovered.

When many people think about saving for retirement they think it is too complicated.  It can be, but most of the time people are over-thinking it.  Saving for retirement doesn't have to be hard, it doesn't have to take a lot of time, and ideally you shouldn't have to think about it much.  There are plenty of ways to make saving for your retirement easy.Setting up retirement accounts might take some work initially, but once they are up and running it should take very little of your time or mental energy.  This makes it very easy in the long run!  You don't need some fancy financial planner and you don't need to micromanage your account and make a lot of changes.  Just set up something simple like a ROTH IRA or a Money Market Account and make the deposits automatic.  Look at your year end statement and determine if your retirement account is still meeting your needs and make adjustments at that time.  When it comes time to retire you will thank your younger self.by Robin Olsen4by Veronica13by Chris Mills21by Mark Shulkosky2by Sally Hayes2by Cruncher3by Mazlan11by Lela16Sign in or sign up and post using a HubPages Network account.No HTML is allowed in comments, but URLs will be hyperlinked.

Islamic industries are expanding globally and governments are taking notice of a sector that could be worth trillions.When Kerim Ture placed his first order for a batch of long-sleeved tunics that could be worn by Muslim women, the manufacturers producing them demanded payment upfront, apparently convinced the venture would fail and Ture would be left unable to pay them.The Turkish entrepreneur quickly proved that their scepticism was unfounded, and he was back shortly afterwards to place a new order, having sold the first.Â Today the website Ture established to sell his products, Modanisa, attracts 100 million visitors annually, has customers in 120 countries, and has no shortage of manufacturers willing to work with it.Â "Modanisa now has 300 suppliers and 30 designers, it's become a platform for hundreds of suppliers from all over the world who want to sell products on our site," a spokesperson for the company told Al Jazeera.However, Ture's story is not simply about one company's success and his own financial achievements.In establishing Modanisa in 2011, Ture wanted to offer Muslim women who chose to adopt "modest" Islamic dress codes, more options than were then available and give them an outlet they had lacked."Just because they (Muslim women) wanted to cover a little more, the world ignored them and they had to suffer with the same old boring clothes," Ture told the audience at a TEDx talk in Bulgaria in May, adding: "We thought it was unfair."Clothing is more than a fabric you put on your body, it's more than that, it's part of your expression and part of your identity, it's unfair."Modanisa is one small part of the diverse and expanding 'halal' sector, which according to research by the Thomson Reuters foundation is estimated to be worth $3.7 trillion by 2019.As 'halal' simply means 'permissible' in the Arabic language, the term can be applied to any product or service, which does not violate Islamic laws and social norms.What separates halal industries from others, which do not necessarily fall foul of Islamic injunctions, is aÂ conscious effort to accommodate the requirements of Muslim consumers.The industries involved are as varied as banks offering services that avoid the accrual of interest and nail varnishÂ that allows a user to perform ablution before prayer.Other major industries include the halal food sector, clothing, and tourism.The trend is particularly noticeable among Muslim communities in western countries, such as the UK, where international brands such as KFC and Subway offer halal menus, clothes shops such as H&M and Marks and Spencer sell clothing lines geared towards Muslim women, supermarkets have halal food sections, and mainstream banks offer Islamic finance products. Â Cardiff University's Dr Jamal Ahmed explained that consumption of 'halal' products was driven just as much by issues of identity as commitment to Islamic rules.Â Jamal Ahmed, Cardiff University"Academic studies have consistently reported that ethnic minorities in general but Muslims in particular, feel more strongly about their identities than people back home (their countries of origin)," Ahmed said."Accordingly, Muslims seek identity anchors when they construct their notions of self and make a statement about who they are."Consuming halal, be it food, clothing, travel or Islamic finance, gives them a sense of identity but also a sense of stability and freedom from anxieties."However, where an individual consumer sees the fulfilment of a religious obligation or act affirming their identity, governments see fiscal growth potential.Recent exhibitions of halal businesses in Japan and Turkey drew backing from the governments of those countries.In 2013, former British Prime Minister David Cameron declared his intent to make London "one of the great capitals of Islamic finance", and announced the issue of the UK's first government bond compliant with Islamic law, becoming the first non-Muslim state to do so.It's not just in the financial industry that countries that are not majority-Muslim are taking a lead role in the growth of the halal sector.Brazil's Muslims make up a tiny part of its population of 207 million people, at just over 200,000, yet the country is a leading exporter of halal beef, with the industry valued at close to $6bn in 2015.Similarly, New Zealand is also a leading exporter of halal meat despite its relatively small Muslim population, with sales of $576m.Abdul Azim Ahmed, a researcher in Contemporary Religion, told Al Jazeera that while the growth in the halal sector gave accessible alternatives to the Muslim population, there was also a danger of "simply reducing Muslim ethics down to consumer choice".Â Abdul Azim Ahmed, Researcher in Contemporary IslamAhmed explained that placing too much emphasis on the consumer end of halal produce, took the focus away from the wider issue of whether aspects such as the manufacturing processes or treatment of workers complied with Islamic ethics."The greater accessibility of halal meat is certainly a good thing in democratising food, there is still however a question to whether or not industrial scale slaughter of animals meets the spirit of Islamic ethics.""Another example, the Nike 'Pro-Hijab' was chosen as one of 2017's top inventions by Time Magazine. The Nike Pro Hijab had negible impact on the lives of Muslim women, and with allegations of abusive work practices still surrounding its many factories, it is right to ask how 'Islamically' ethical are the products being pitched at Muslims."I believe a truly Islamic approach to business, manufacturing, and conservation requires a fundamentally more radical approach involving governments and transnational organisations, and that it will not be achieved by a shift in consumer practice."

            SOURCE: Al Jazeera NewsSince March 2015, Saudi Arabia and a coalition of Arab states have launched more than 19,278 air raids across Yemen.Many Pentecostal churches in the Niger Delta offer to deliver people from witchcraft and possession - albeit for a fee.No, it wasn't because of WMDs, democracy or Iraqi oil. The real reason is much more sinister than that.

	 AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementDuurzame energie. Is dat niet iets wat we allemaal willen? We schrijven dit in visiedocumenten en bedrijfsfilosofieën en het is niet meer weg te denken uit de samenleving. Het doel is zelfs om in 2050 landelijk energieneutraal zijn. In de uitvoeringsagenda van ons dorp las ik dat dit al meteen kan, want de techniek is voorhanden en er is voldoende ruimte. Als we in ons dorp ongeveer 25 windmolens plaatsen, 10% van de oppervlakte uitrusten met zonnepanelen en een paar flinke vergisters vergunnen, dan is het klusje geklaard. De 4 nadelen

Maar, zo eenvoudig is dat niet. Het belangrijkste probleem is het netwerk dat een vertakking vanaf de centrale naar de eindgebruikers kent. Als die eindgebruikers centrales worden, dan zijn de aftakkingen niet geschikt voor de omgekeerde route. Een tweede nadeel is dat energiestromen niet geleidelijk vrijkomen, maar nadrukkelijke pieken kennen.Er is nog een derde probleem, en dat is dat deze installaties ook overlast veroorzaken. Dit omdat het zicht op de installaties niet als prettig wordt ervaren en er verschillende ongewenste bijeffecten zijn: spiegeling, geur schaduw en/of geluid. Het vierde en laatste probleem is dat veel van de technieken op zichzelf niet rendabel zijn. Er is dus subsidie nodig en die is er ook niet oneindig.In het afgelopen jaar is, ondanks de bovenstaande nadelen, het aandeel duurzame energie in Nederland toegenomen van 6,6% in 2017 naar 7,3% in 2018. Om in 2023 op koers te zitten, moet 16% van de energie afkomstig zijn uit hernieuwbare bronnen. Naarmate het aandeel duurzame energie stijgt, neemt echter ook de zwaarte van de nadelen toe.Accu's bieden een oplossing voor veel van deze problemen, maar zijn nog niet helemaal uitontwikkeld. Bij TNO staat al een praktijkoplossing in de stijgers voor woonhuizen. En bij een project in het noorden van het land wordt zelfs een veebedrijf uitgerust met accu’s, die voldoende groot zijn om alle benodigde energie voor dat bedrijf vrij te geven. Kortom: waar een wil is, is een weg. Energiebesparing

Volgens mij moeten we sterk inzetten op energiebesparing, waardoor we ongeveer de helft van de problemen al kunnen tackelen. Gedurende mijn bezoeken voor 'energiescans' zie ik dat er geweldige kansen zijn om iets aan energiebesparing te doen. Waar veehouders werken aan plannen om met een investering van €100.000 een rendement van 5% (oftewel €5.000 per jaar) te realiseren, kom ik na een paar bezoekjes met gemak op een jaarlijkse besparing die het dubbele bedraagt.Soms is er inderdaad een investering voor nodig, maar dat bedrag is vaak niet van meer dan €10.000. De terugverdientijden variëren daarmee van 0 tot 5 jaar. Pas wanneer deze mogelijkheden uitgeput zijn, denken we over andere zaken (zoals zonnepanelen, warmtepompen en biomassaketels). Ook interessant, maar pas van latere orde. Productieproblemen

Soms bestaat de vrees dat het besparen op het energieverbruik leidt tot productieproblemen. Deze vrees is deels terecht, want we zoeken immers de grens op. Echter, ik durf te stellen dat er evenveel problemen zijn door onnodig extra verbruik: denk aan oplopende weerstanden, waardoor ook tocht, lekkage en slijtage in de hand gewerkt worden.Je moet ook denken aan warmte die vrijkomt op een plaats waar dat niet gewenst is, zoals het kraamhok. De zeug functioneert het beste bij 16 graden Celsius, de biggen bij 30 graden Celsius. Regelmatig kom ik zeugen tegen die warmer liggen dan de biggen. Aangezien warmte die gemiddeld vrijkomt uit een vleesvarkensbedrijf voldoende is om 5 andere bedrijven van gelijke omvang te voorzien, wordt er weinig gas verbruikt.Het lukt mij op deze bedrijven dan wel om een flinke elektrabesparing te adviseren. Aangezien je hier bij varkensbedrijven al snel bij de ventilatie uitkomt, is het wel noodzakelijk dat je als adviseur goed op de hoogte bent van de klimaatzaken. Overheid grijpt in

De overheid grijpt ook in om bedrijven meer energie te laten besparen. Vanaf 1 juli 2019 moeten bedrijven die meer dan 50.000 kWh verbruiken verplicht een energiescan laten doen. Hierin staat onder meer welke besparingsmogelijkheden het bedrijf heeft en wanneer deze gerealiseerd kunnen worden. Enerzijds is dit jammer, omdat hierdoor de motivatie die nodig is om er echt iets aan te doen, ontbreekt. Anderzijds zullen een aantal bedrijven van deze nood een deugd maken en het ombuigen in een voordeel.Daarentegen zullen er ook bedrijven zijn die al zuinig werken, waardoor er nog maar weinig te besparen valt. Daarnaast zijn er bedrijven waar juist veel te besparen valt, maar waar het vermogen ontbreekt om de benodigde investering te doen. Ook hier zijn mooie oplossingen voor te bedenken. Vermogen komt immers al lang niet altijd meer van de bank; zeker als het gaat om rendabele duurzaamheidsinvesteringen. Kortom: heel veel neuzen staan al de goede kant op als het gaat om de duurzaamheidsgedachte.© DCA MultiMedia. Op deze marktinformatie berust auteursrecht.

The capstone of this specialization is designed with the goal of allowing you to experience this process. The capstone project will take you from data to analysis and models, and ultimately to presentation of insights. 

In this capstone project, you will analyze the data on financial loans to help with the investment decisions of an investment company. You will go through all typical steps of a data analytics project, including data understanding and cleanup, data analysis, and presentation of analytical results. 
For the first week, the goal is to understand the data and prepare the data for analysis. As we discussed  in this specialization, data preprocessing and cleanup is often the first step in data analytics projects. Needless to say, this step is crucial for the success of this project.  

In the second week, you will perform some predictive analytics tasks, including classifying loans and predicting losses from defaulted loans. You will try a variety of tools and techniques  this week, as the predictive accuracy of different tools can vary quite a bit. It is rarely the case that the default model produced by ASP is the best model possible. Therefore, it is important for you to tune the different models in order to improve the performance.

Beginning in the third week, we turn our attention to prescriptive analytics, where you will provide some concrete suggestions on how to allocate investment funds using analytics tools, including clustering and simulation based optimization. You will see that allocating funds wisely is crucial for the financial return of the investment portfolio.

In the last week, you are expected to present your analytics results to your clients. Since you will obtain many results in your project, it is important for you to judiciously choose what to include in your presentation. You are also expected to follow the principles we covered in the courses in preparing your presentation.HauptmenÃ¼:2012N4ALrobWªÆ©uhÅubcR[vðèoµÜµ½B»ÌbcR[ÍAgNziÁèÛpHij¤iÅA­Jn¼ã©çålCÆÈèA­QTÔÅNÔÚWÅ Á½100P[XðB¬µA2012N9ÉÍÌÚWðÌV{ÆÈé700P[XÉø«ã°Üµ½BX|T[h N

CorporationSuggested Keywords: Account types, DRIPs, Routing number, IP, Penny stocksSuggested Keywords: Account types, DRIPs, Routing number, IP, Penny stocksMike Loewengart, Vice President of Investment StrategyE*TRADE Capital Management2018 marked a turning point in the financial markets, punctuated by volatility, trade wars, rising interest rates, and a shifting political dyanmic.So, what does the new year hold in store? Here are five themes to follow in 2019:While most of the worldâs economies are expanding and the economic outlook is generally sound, there remain obstacles to growth in 2019.Trade wars: Over the past year, the Trump administration has slapped more than $250 billion in tariffs on China alone, but the administration has also targeted steel, aluminum, solar panels and appliances imported from other countries.1 Who is winning the trade war? Many economists would say no one, since tariffs increase the price of imports and can be an impediment to economic growth.Budget deficits: Tax cuts enacted in 2017, coupled with increased military spending, have ballooned the federal budget deficit, which could surpass $1 trillion in 2019. Budget deficits can cause interest rates to rise, because higher yields are needed to attract creditors. Higher interest rates could, in turn, impede economic growth.Brexit: The UK is slated to leave the European Union in 2019, but the exit terms are still murky. The 2016 Brexit vote has already been a stumbling block to growth in the UK, and a formal exit from the trading bloc could materially affect growth as well.Bottom line: While decelerating economic growth doesnât bode well for the markets as a whole, high-quality bonds, overlooked value stocks, and more defensive sectors could benefit.Novemberâs midterm elections resulted in a divided government, with Democrats regaining control of the House of Representatives and Republicans expanding their hold on the Senate. A divided government can result in gridlock at the Capitol, slowing the pace of legislation.While this may frustrate voters, fewer potential bills could be a salve to investors, who would have less legislative uncertainty to navigate. Moreover, the US economy has expanded during periods of divided government beforeâincluding during the early stretches of the most recent bull market.Bottom line: Divided government could provide a tailwind to the markets.The Federal Reserve has lifted short-term interest rates three times this year but has hinted at slowing the pace of monetary tightening as rates move closer to neutral.Inflation: Consumer price inflation hasnât risen significantly of late, but it is running at the Fedâs target rate of 2%. Until inflation moves lower, the Fed could continue to raise rates.Unemployment: The US unemployment rate dipped to 3.5% in the third quarter and has remained close to that figure since. With unemployment at a 49-year low, additional gains in an already-tight labor market seem unlikely. Given stiff competition for workers and talent, wage inflation is the more pressing issue. Whether low unemployment causes wages to continue rising remains to be seen.Interest rates: Could higher rates inhibit economic growth? Keep in mind that the Fed is tasked with promoting maximum employment and keeping prices stable; economic growth isnât among its mandates.Bottom line: A more normalized rate environment could provide the Fed with additional dry powder to expand monetary policy by lowering interest rates if needed. Â Despite higher rates, bonds lost only nominal amounts in 2018, and short-term Treasuries provided much-needed stability when stocks sold off in the third quarter.Treasury yield curve: Investors remain concerned about the flattening yield curve, as an inverted yield curve can signal that a recession is on the horizon. Recently, parts of the short end of the curve have, in fact, inverted. However, there are two important caveats: First, parts of the yield curve do invert from time to time, and the most-watched portion between 2- and 10-year Treasuries is not inverted at the time of this writing. Second, even in times of a more pronounced curve inversion, a recession is typically one to two years off.Investment-grade, high-yield bonds: Higher short-term rates could provide income opportunities with lower risk than more rate-sensitive long-term bonds and income-oriented equities. And, unless the economy falls into recession, default rates are likely to stay low. This could make corporate bonds attractive, although credit spreads are still quite tight.Bottom line: Higher rates could provide investors with additional yield opportunities, and there are certainly relative value opportunities available.In August, a long-running equity bull market became the longest on record since World War II. Since then, however, stocks have been roiled by volatility. Will the markets remain unsettled in 2019?Growth vs. value: Growth stocks have outperformed value shares for the better part of the past decade, including the past year. However, given the Fedâs more restrictive monetary policy, it remains to be seen whether growth stocks can continue their pattern of dominanceâespecially since value stocks have the potential to outperform in more defensive environments that emphasize individual stock selection.Small caps vs large caps: At the onset of the current trade war, it was thought that tariffs would affect large, global firms more than small companies with US-focused operations. Nonetheless, small caps have underperformed large caps in 2018, and we appear to be late in the business cycle. If the economy slows, large caps could be better positioned to navigate more challenging long-term market conditions.US vs international equities: On the heels of a strong 2017, international equities disappointed in 2018. But with compelling valuations and low correlations to US equities, international equities have important implications for portfolio diversification.Bottom line: Valuations for both international equities and value stocks remain compelling.With the midterm elections in the rear-view mirror, investors finally have at least one issue of uncertainty resolved. A November E*TRADE survey found that more than half of survey respondentsâparticularly young investorsâexpected the midterm results to benefit them financially. Nonetheless, headwinds remain in the form of ongoing trade disputes, higher interest rates, and soaring budget deficits that leave few fiscal tools available to fine-tune the economy.While large-cap growth stocks led the bull run in previous years, in 2019 this could change if the market stops advancing in lockstep and assets become uncorrelated. In that environment, individual stock selection and a focus on company fundamentals could come to the forefront.Mike LoewengartVice President, Investment StrategyE*TRADE Capital Management, LLCMike Loewengart is the Vice President of Investment Strategy for E*TRADE Capital Management, LLC.
