# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Business-using-Hadoop
Performed Sentiment analysis of People on gun violence on Twitter data and compared that with NYTimes articles and media articles obtained using CommonCrawl. Hadoop is used to perform the word count and co-occurance of top words in two sets of data. I have used Tableau for word-could and python to implement mapper and reducer of Hadoop framework.
